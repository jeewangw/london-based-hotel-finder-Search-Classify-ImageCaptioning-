Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Ottima qualità prezzo,"Siamo stati a Londra per un week end ed abbiamo alloggiato in questo ottimo Hotel prenotato da amici. | Personale molto gentile e disponibile, camere sufficientemente grandi ma soprattutto pulite e confortevoli con un letto matrimoniale grande e comodo, tv grande, impianto stereo Bose, . | Bagno grande con asciugacapelli, vasca da bagno, doccia, accappatoio, ciabatte, ecc. ma soprattutto pulito! | Ottima posizione sebbene sia nella zona finanziaria e quindi il fine settimana praticamente deserta ma per noi è stato forse un vantaggio per la tranquillità e visto che in pochi minuti si raggiungono zone molto vivaci. | In ogni caso muoversi non è un problema: la metro di Moorgate è a due passi così come la stazione della metro e dei treni Liverpool Street (treno con collegamento diretto all'aeroporto di Stansted). | Nel periodo in cui siamo stati noi stavano ristrutturando e quindi probabilmente oggi sarà ancora meglio, da tornare e da consigliare! | Abbiamo speso per 2 notti senza colazione (evitata visto il costo e le opinioni negative) 257Sterline.","Casale Monferrato, Italy",10/20/2012
Corinthia Hotel London,5,"By far, my best hotel in the world","I had a pleasure of staying in this hotel for 7 nights recently. This hotel was perfect in every way. Communication with the hotel before staying was prompt, and very efficient. Checking in was a breeze. You go through the spectacular lobby with modern glass chandeliers and take the elevator to your room. My room, they gave me an upgrade to junior suite, was spectacular. We had a walk-in closet of the size where you could have put a small bed in there; it served us nicely for the seven day stay. The decor was very refined, and oh the bathroom! Carrera marble floor was heated throughout, rain shower was to die for! | Location, as it turned out, was as good as it can be. We were 5 minutes walk to Trafalgar Square, but it was very quiet. Right outside was Embankment tube stop. We would walk to theater area and to numerous restaurants, and many major sites, such as London Eye or Westminster Abbey were within walking distance. | We had buffet breakfast or room service every morning. It was pricy, but my rate included it. Couple of nights, we had glass of wine sitting in front of fire place in the lobby. I used the spa, which is included in the room rate, almost every night. After a windchill day of sightseeing, the steam sauna and jacuzzi would soften my weary muscles. | I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world, but this hotel tops it. I would return here in a heartbeat next time I am in London.","Savannah, Georgia",3/23/2016
The Savoy,5,First visit to the American Bar at the Savoy,"A very lovely first visit to this iconic hotel bar! | Wonderful service, without being intrusive at all! Very delicious cocktails and just generally all round, a very indulgent experience. | Well worth visiting only for that 'once in a lifetime' experience, though do make sure you are feeling 'flush' it doesn't come cheap!",London,7/30/2013
Rhodes Hotel,4,Nice stay,"3 of us stayed at the Rhodes Hotel for 4 nights, its a great location for taking the Paddington Express from Heathrow. We like the location clost to the partk and in walking distance of most locations. The room and bath were small compared to American Hotels but very clean. We enjoyed the free WIFI. The owners and the staff were very friendly and helpful with taxi's and resturant recomendations. We would stay there again.","Maui, Hawaii",6/2/2012
The Savoy,5,Perfection,Form the moment we arrived until we left we experienced absolute perfection in service excellance by every member of The Savoy staff. Famous for its personalise service and rich heritage the Savoy is truly won of the best hotels in the world to stay at. For eating and dining woud highly recommend Kaspers restaurant. For ourselves we cannot wait until we return.,"London, United Kingdom",11/24/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,1,Staff stole from me!!,"Well I am no strange to London's 5star hotels and when a new one comes along I am eager to try. So I heard about the corinthia via some friends who work in the industry and said their bar was really something. Until the incident I had stay there a total of 3 times but on the 4th time in June I was on my second of 4 nights and was about get some cash from my room as I was going to exchange money for some dollars as I was flying to the US pretty soon. When I came to my money it felt light. When I counted it, it was almost £1000 down. Obviously shocked I contacted reception. They started an investigation! | Well a couple of days later I had to checkout and the matter was not resolved. I was made to pay my bill in full. | Upon my return to London I met up with a manager at the hotel Jean Louis. He said the matter was still under investigation and he gave me his card to get in touch. Nothing was ever resolved. | This hotel does not only boast to be one of the best hotels in London but one of the best in the world. You pay premium for this reason and you expect a premium service. This hotel epically failed me and dented my confidence in the hotel industry. I didn't even get a formal apology. | It's a lovely hotel but I would have to say stay at your own risk but for over £500 a night should there be any risk?",NA,3/1/2013
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Great customer service and comfy bed,"The hotel staff were very helpful, I booked the wrong hotel by mistake and they changed it without any hassle. The staff were great. Greeted with a glass of prosecco and a lovely comfortable room. Bed was very comfortable. Would definitely stay there again.","Lostwithiel, United Kingdom",10/22/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,"Yes, it's really good!","Already stepping out of the taxi you get that very special feeling of welcome. A friendly smile, a helping hand and yet with lot's of attitude. Who ever organises this, its very well done. | At the front desk it's, as almost everywhere, very complicated and slow to check-in. All has been done already when reserving the room. How difficult can it be to swipe the card and get the key card? | But that's is quickly forgotten when using the room, the Bar and the Restaurant. Everything is smart and comfy and nicely designed. And the service is excellent. Well done.",Stockholm,12/16/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Incredible,What an incredibly cool place. Had the most delicious and interesting cocktails at Dandelion (bar) followed by an incredible meal at Sea Containers (restaurant). The staff were so friendly and the service was exceptional. Rumpus Room (top floor bar) is the perfect place for a night cap - very cool and with a great atmosphere. I could not recommend Mondrian more!,"London, England, United Kingdom",3/5/2016
Rhodes Hotel,5,Ottima scelta!,"Ottimo rapporto qualità - prezzo, ottima la posizione, a due passi dal centro e ben servita di metro e bus.Letti comodi e stanza sempre pulita..Ho provato solo la colazione Italiana e non quella Inglese, ma come posso dimenticarmi di quei cornetti con dentro spalmata la nutella!!..Ho detto tutto!Ottima anche la cortesia e la disponibilità di tutti i dipendenti.",Cagliari,2/7/2011
The Savoy,5,Best in Town,"The Savoy is The Savoy, every time I came back the real surprise is that all it's the same, same top services, same astonishing place, same awesome rooms. | I have been in the city for work several time and try many different places, same level, and every time I came back here I ask myself why to chose another one! | Living here is like a travel back in time, when gentlemen was gentlemen, and London was the heart | of the world.","Milan, Italy",5/18/2017
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",4,"Good hotel, but needs touch-up and improved layout of entrance floor","The location next to the park and close to Harvey Nic and Harrods means that you not only have great shopping nearby, but also great restaurants. Mandarin Oriental is on of the best hotel groups, perhaps even the best, but their London property needs some TLC. I got great service, a nice upgrade (large room), but it was too used to feel like a real MO. Its like getting the old BA first class vs. the new; its good, but dated. And you know they can do better. The bar was nicer before the redid it some time ago, and its more drunk biz-pople than a mixed crowd there. Dinner by Heston was closed due to flew issues?? for a week, and Baloud in the basement is not very cozy or elegant. Comparing London to the still great NYC property, or the fantastic Bangkok property, its not worthy of the MO-brand. But its still a good hotel, make no mistake. Call in the designers and redo the reception, bar and first floor area with some seating, touch-up the rooms, and the impression will be so much better!","Oslo, Norway",2/17/2014
The Savoy,2,what a disappointment,"was so looking forward to staying here had high expections, what a let down it was we had a connecting room as we took the children, rooms are small they are clean but for over £1000 a night u expect a bit more there was five of us altogether and felt like we was crammed in | staff are rude I've stayed a cheaper hotels and got treated better","Derby, United Kingdom",6/5/2016
The Dorchester,4,Great hotel needs to up its game to compete today,"Just a short stay mainly focussed around the Alain Ducasse restaurant with friends | The rooms are quite nice not dissimilar to Claridges, I think there is room for improvement in in room facilities escpaially at this price point (when the rates go up around other city activities) | I do think it would be incredibly costly to modernise the hotel so a tasteful refurb would be great as some hall carpets are very tired.",Cheshire,1/4/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,a true five star hotel,"The Corinthia is a hotel that I expect when I read that a hotel is five stars. The rooms are spacious, the bed was as comfortable as home. The bathroom was large with two sinks and a great shower as well as a separate bath and soft fluffy towels. Of course everything was very clean. The service and the concierge were accessible and always helpful. The location in Westminster was ideal for touring, shopping and of course to the Underground. The only negative was the price of the food in the restaurants. A tiny caesar salad that was nothing special for 22 pounds is not memorable. Regardless, I would be delighted to stay there again.",Pittsburgh,10/6/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Surprisingly quiet in Central London,I booked 1 night DBB choosing this hotel as it was so close to the Barbican where my daughter was graduating. We stayed Sunday night and I have never know London so quiet! | We were upgraded on arrival to a room with a balcony which was great as it was also our wedding anniversary and we enjoyed sitting on the balcony sipping wine - absolutely loved the HUGE bathroom and complimentary toiletries including my first rubber duck. Modern decor but with everything you need eg iron etc. | Dinner was tasty as was breakfast. | City streets were busier the following morning but it's definitely a hotel chain I would seek out again,Lincolnshire,11/13/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Amazing proposal venue!,"Well, what can I say...I chose this venue to propose to my girlfriend (now fiance!) as it was a brand new hotel and has had excellent reviews since it's been open. I wasn't disappointed! | Before I booked the room, I got in touch with the hotel to let them know my plans. The Guest Experience Manager (Luke Neill) was more than happy to personally show me around the hotel, show me the various room types and also the bars and restaurants available. | I went for the River View Balcony Suite, as it was very spacious, beautifully decorated and offered one of the best views of the river and London, right from it's very own private balcony. The balcony overlooks St Pauls, and as most visitors to London will know, central London at night is a must see! | Before I proposed, we went for a few drinks in the Rumpus Room, which is the Mondrian's rooftop terrace bar which offers 360 degree views around London. The atmosphere of the bar is very chic and sophisticated, offering an excellent signature cocktail list. | Throughout the trip, the staff were all incredibly attentive and really did all they could to help me with the proposal and make sure that the whole experience was a magical one. | Really would recommend the hotel and we'll definitely be back.","London, United Kingdom",1/8/2015
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Beautiful,"The Mandarin in London lives up to the five star rating that it deserves. Beautiful and spacious room with wonderful decorations. Great service and staff and perfectly located next to the Knightsbridge subway. Even when my room was not quite ready for check-in, the staff made sure I could use their spa facilities in the interim (which was also quite lovely). I plan on returning to this hotel for my future trips to London. Oh and I loved their Japanese breakfast. Delish!","Los Angeles, California",8/31/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Beautiful hotel in a great location,We had an amazing time staying at the Mondrian for our wedding. In total we had 20+ rooms and the feedback from everyone was fantastic. The staff couldn't have been more welcoming and they went out of their way to add little touches to our stay that really helped make our wedding weekend. The hotel is gorgeous and has amazing views out onto the river. The bars and the restaurant are great fun,London,12/10/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Very stylish accommodation,A nice and stylish hotel with a very impressive lobby. Staff is extremely helpful. Splendid location alongside the Thames. Just across the One Blackfriars train station and within short walking distance from the underground.,Galmaarden,6/13/2016
The Dorchester,2,The brand is bigger than the experience,"I had always wanted to stay at The Dorchester. It seems so grand and quintessentially British. Well, the lobby is anyway. We stayed six nights and after the first night asked to change rooms. We were staying in a standard king room and all I can say is it was shabby without the chic. Furniture is worn out, rug unraveling, and really no light as there was only a small window. For the pleasure of $100 USD more per night, we got moved to a refurbished room (ask when you check in). | The hallways really smell like grandma's attic - no kidding. | The service was also very hit and miss (as it turns out). | -- We tried on two separate evenings to get a bottle of champagne put on ice before we returned to the hotel but both times we returned to the room with no ice bucket (and this was with several hours notice). To be fair, after whining about it (because I was not happy), two complimentary glasses of champagne did show up with a nice bowl of nuts. | -- Thinking it was an apology, a fruit plate also showed up (it was put in our room but not meant for us). Sorry Mr. Smith but you will not be getting your welcome fruit plate. | -- When we moved rooms they didn't bring the guard railing for the toddler bed. We called and called. When we got back to the room late, there was a guard rail but it was literally in about 20 pieces laying on the ground by the door with the box next to it. Where we suppose to put it together for them? | On the plus side, the housekeeping staff are really good. Your room looks great when you return. They adjust the number of towels you need based on how you use them. The sheets are also extremely soft. | I've read all the reviews of how fabulous the service is and how special they make you feel -- we just didn't get that. We have been fortunate to stay in some fabulous five-star hotels around the world and this experience just didn't stack up.",Hong Kong,10/3/2013
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,3,Nice rooms but not quite wow,"Nice visit but didn't feel special. Upgraded to superior room on top floor (extra £35) so big room &amp; nice drencher shower. Room was very nicely done out. Didn't have a bar just for residents, so meant we couldn't get a table for pre dinner cocktails but sat at the bar and was fine. Rooftop bar doesn't open on Sundays even at bank hols which was a shame. For the rate we got it was good, but didn't have anything of a wow factor to justify top price. Didn't feel the service made it feel like a special experience. In summary, nothing wrong with it but feel there are nicer places to stay for time away together.",Woking,5/31/2016
Rhodes Hotel,4,Great Hosts,Chris and Maria were wonderful hosts. We stayed at the Rhodes during our honeymoon and they bought us champagne the first night we were there because they wanted to make our stay a little more special. Both were incredibly friendly and they were especially helpful in directing us around London and booking tickets for us for different attractions right from their front desk. Would reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants a more personable stay.,"Rochester NY girl in Harrisburg, PA",5/17/2007
A To Z Hotel,5,Excellent rapport qualité prix,"A 15 mn à pied, 5 en bus (passage fréquent) de la station de métro north acton (central line), un hotel simple mais suffisant pour petits budgets. C'est vrai, les tiroirs du petit bureau sont cassés , il n'y a pas de table de nuit.... C'est petit mais suffisant pour dormir et se laver. C'est tres propre, draps et serviettes comme le sol et la salle d'eau. Nettoyage tous les matins et serviettes propres. Accueil timide (tenu par des indiens) mais serviable (nous ont gardé une journee nos bagages le dernier jour). Petit déjeuner ok, toasts, beurre, café ou thé, jus d'orange, pot de lait, confitures. Tres calme, on a bien dormi pendant 6 nuits. Bref, à recommander, pour le prix c'est tres bien, meme plus propre que des hotels beaucoup plus chers dans le centre!","Paris, France",1/5/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,"Fantastic nights stay, one of the best hotels I've ever been to!","My partner and I found this hotel by chance and saw it had good reviews. We couldn't have made a better choice! Every member of staff that we came into contact with were amazingly helpful and would go out of their way to make your stay as fantastic as possible!! The room was incredible, especially as it was only a ""standard room"". Very good price for what you get, the breakfast was faultless and wouldn't second guess going there again! I would recommend phoning them to book a room as you can make them aware of any special requirements needed.",NA,6/20/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Corinthia Hotel London - WOW,"I have just returned from a very quick trip to London. I stayed at the Corinthia Hotel which was just spectacular. Located very conveniently at Whitehall Place. Warm welcome after a long flight from San Francisco. Check in very friendly and effcient. Room was terrific. Spacious, extremely comfortable and stunning to look at. Bathroom is great with a huge bathtub. Dressing room with convenient full length mirror - plentiful hanging space and hangers. Hotel has free wi-fi . Spa is pretty much beyond description. Be ready for an experience !! Lounges and restaruants are excellent. Hotel staff - everyone goes the extra mile to be friendly and still very professional. My only complaint - I wasn't there long enough. I am a Travel Consultant and would recommend this Hotel to my clients with total confidence.",san francisco,11/28/2011
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Excellent service,It's a family trip by staying at a business district hotel. The location is convenient to get connection to shopping areas with the tube. Rooms are nice and clean. | I appreciate very much about the reception staff and restaurant staff. They are very helpful and friendly especially the ladies (one named Eva at the reception). The restaurant staff do remember what drink we have ordered on the 2nd visit for BKF. They do a very good welcoming and we enjoy the stay a lot.,"Hong Kong, China",1/31/2017
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Excellent,"Nous avons pris l'habitude de descendre dans cet hotel familial à chaque escapade à Londres, situation au top, propreté impécable, service sans faille du personnel, et un excelent petit dejeuner (et la gentillesse de Rita). | Mr &amp; Mrs Rees, les propriétaires sont la pour vous conseiller et endossent l'habit de concierge à la perfection. | Les chambres sont petites, certes, avec un deco decalée qui semble ne pas avoir évoluée depuis des années, nous qui sommes plus attirés par le Vintage et des hotels plus ""tendance"" (nous sommes d'ailleurs à Paris ce weekend pour le salon du Vintage), mais tres confortables et suffisantes pour y dormir. | Quant aux prix, nous sommes à londres ... | Un hotel à ne pas manquer que nous recommandons avec plaisir !!!","Zurich, Switzerland",10/30/2011
Rhodes Hotel,5,It's All True!,"I'm always a little skeptical about what I read, but the glowing reviews of the Rhodes Hotel are all true. The location could not be better; Paddinton Station, Hyde Park and good food are all steps away. The rooms are quaint, comfortable and extremely clean. There's no elevator, which is probably good because it gives you a chance to walk off some of the ample breakfast. (Chris usually made a little something special for everyone to taste.) Our bags were carried up and down for us and there are conveniences that the big hotels don't offer like free wi-fi or use of their computer, free direct dial telephone and a frig in the room. But certainly the best thing about the Rhodes is not a thing, it's Chris and Maria. Maria is a fount of useful helpful information about where to go and how to get there. She takes each guest under her wing and treats them as if they are the only one staying with them. She arranged for a car to take us to Heathrow that was cheaper than the tube. Chris is not only an excellent chef but very interested in his guests and the world around him. They make a great pair and together they run a quiet, comfortable and affordable hotel. We were sorry to say good-bye to them and will definitely stay with them again.",San Diego,10/5/2006
The Savoy,5,Exceeded All My Expectations,"This was the most wonderful stay. Every little detail was attended to with alacrity and grace. From the warm welcome at the door by everyone on staff to the elegance of the room, we found ourselves lavished with Old World British service and attention. The suite we had (River View) was simply stunning. Very comfortable and elegant. After having been in a couple of other countries, the punctuality of our room service deliveries was appreciated. There was a leak from the ceiling of our suite and after it was reported, we were moved to another suite while we were out for dinner. Everything was moved and set up exactly as it had been in the previous suite! Right down to a little something which had been on the floor under the writing table. Amazing! We loved it and hope we have the opportunity to stay at the Savoy again on another trip to London.","Claremont, California",10/14/2013
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",3,"Great location, fine hotel, odd service","We stayed for a few days in October, and it was a perfectly adequate hotel for our needs (a few days of leisurely sightseeing/shopping/eating). The location is wonderful- right at the Hyde Park corner tube stop, and across the street from Hyde Park. We enjoyed morning walks/runs/coffee every morning of our stay. There are a few pubs/restaurants nearby, as well as the bar/restaurant of the hotels in that area, but it's more of a residential/embassy area. Our room was fine, although on the first floor and a mostly frosted glass window with not much light coming through. The marble bathroom with heated floor is a nice touch! Everything was clean. The reason I gave it 3 stars is actually the service. Most people were polite, but there was were a few distinctive &amp; unhelpful interactions during our stay. First, we arrived pretty early from an international, overnight flight. We were obviously kind of tired and hoping they might have a room available, although fully aware they may not. We arrived to the hotel around 8:30am, and a room was not offered to us until 2:15pm. We had a very overpriced breakfast in the hotel, went for a long walk, and came back around 11:30, at which point we needed to change for a lunch. They offered us the stairwell &amp; lobby bathrooms to change in...which was really not very useful, although we did it. The other main issue I had was that their service in terms of our room &amp; belongings was rather invasive. They sent a butler to show the ""room features"", and then at turn down on the first night, they did quite a bit of unnecessary &amp; unwelcome unpacking of our clothes. They put things in the closet that we had to search for when we returned, and even put some clothes (some of which were our pajamas!) into the hotel laundry bag. I don't know if most people use the laundry service, but we were there for only a few days and it was most annoying for them to presume (and select which clothes) that we would send out our laundry. These were minor incidents, but because the place prides itself on service, I found this incongruous. We also asked twice to use the hotel car, and it was not available either time. We got a fairly good deal, and with the comfortable bed, clean bath &amp; great location, I would have felt like it was a place I could recommend. The invasive nature of the daily cleaning &amp; turndown services however truly detracted from our experience.",NC,11/8/2016
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,exceptional service. great location. brilliant food.,mandarin oriental hyde park has pretty much everything. as astounding location at knightsbridge/hyde park makes access to london simple. first class service from staff makes a stay thoroughly enjoyable. two great in-house restaurants add much to the package. dinner by heston blumenthal is a must-do.,england,5/17/2015
The Dorchester,5,Outstanding,One of the best ever. You really think you have arrived. Great dining. Clearly one of the worlds best. Rooms elegant ; most luxurious baths you have ever seen. Staff outstanding. Can't say too much about this hotel.,"Saint Louis, Missouri",11/15/2014
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Apex London Wall repeat visit,This is really just to provide another 5-star rating for this hotel and the staff who work there. I echo all of the other good reviews that the accommodation/cleanliness and staff have received and are looking forward to a return visit. Two recommendations for food and drink are the Brasserie Zedel in Piccadilly and the Princess of Wales in Primrose Hill - pretty random but two excellent places to stop by.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",12/8/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Just as good second time around!,"After an amazing experience the first time we stayed, we went back to the mondrian for a family birthday. It did not disappoint. The place is beautiful, great location with wonderful views, and the food and service is amazing. We were in touch with the lovely Luke in guest services who looked after us seamlessly throughout the organising process and really showed us an incredible and special time. He went above and beyond for us to make our day run perfectly. Thank you! We had a wonderful day and will definitely be back!",NA,10/15/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Felt like a princess,"Took my mum here for a treat weekend in March - and what a treat it was. | We both felt like royalty not only because the surroundings are so plush but the staff make you feel like you're the only guest there and you're the most important. | Amazing service, good quality, beautiful surroundings.",london,10/20/2013
The Savoy,3,Safety concerns.....,"Lovely furnishings, amenities and service. However, when returning to my suite early one afternoon, I discovered an unexpected visitor. Unbeknownst to the ""visitor"", I had observed him entering my room from a distance. He appeared to be a maintenance person but later I realized he may have had more in mind than maintenance. | Some indicators: He did not place notification of his presence on the door so I would be aware of him before I entered; when I entered I called out and he did not reply or in any way acknowledge his presence (he may have thought I was housekeeping and would leave without discovering him in this fairly large 4 room suite); even as I entered the sitting room, he did not make himself known; once I observed him, he did not identify himself; his stance and location in the very center of the bedroom with no tools in hand was awkward; his explanation of repairing the ceiling chandelier which was - and had been - working perfectly was obviously fabricated on the spot; his sardonic remark as he quickly left was frightening. In hind sight I believe this person had malicious intentions. | All was reported to management. I requested a change of locking mechanisms but this request was declined. I was offered a fresh pot of tea. | After returning home, I had a brief email communication with the head of maintenance who assured me it was a maintenance employee who had entered to replace a light bulb. However he failed to explain why the man did not have a ladder with him as the light bulbs would not be visible without being able to see above the shades which were about 7 to 8 feet above the floor, much less be able to replace the bulbs. | I also sent an email to the regional office about two weeks ago and have yet to receive a reply. | Add to my experience the feeble fairy tale told by maintenance, the failure of a response from regional, and the casual attitude of the manager on site, it does appear there are security issues. Management does not want to discuss the problem, of course, because of negative publicity. | In hindsight I should have reported this to the police. I would advise not to stay at this hotel.",British Columbia,10/22/2015
The Rembrandt,5,Good Hotel - Great Area,"Very good hotel in a lovely area. Handy to the tube, Harrods and museums. Breakfast was good - coffee was the best bit. We found the towels in our room were slightly dirty the first night but apart from that, can't complain. Comfy bed and pillow :)",NA,11/4/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Freundliches & zukommendes Personal sowie sehr gute Lage,"Wir waren im Rahmen einer Städtereise für 3 Übernachtungen zu Gast im ""Apex London Wall Hotel"". Am Empfang wurden wir sehr freundlich begrüßt. Da wir bereits früh morgen angereist sind und die Zimmer verständlicherweise noch nicht bezugsfertig waren konnten wir unser Gepäck kostenlos abstellen. Dieses wurde später dann direkt durch das Personal auf das Zimmer gebracht. Unser Zimmer mit der Nummer 525 war toll eingerichtet und sehr sauber (siehe Bilder). Nach einem langen Sightseeing und Shopping Tag in London genau das richtige Hotel!","Roedermark, Germany",9/15/2012
The Savoy,5,The gift of a lifetime and a memory to last for ever,"A weekend at The Savoy-what more could a mother ask for as a special birthday present? My biggest fear was that as we didn't fit into the usual demograph of Savoy customers we would feel uncomfortable-not so at all.Our son who is a frequent business traveler used his ""points"" for our weekend -it gave him the opportunity to assess the hotel for his business too.We were welcomed personally and check in was smooth. Shown up to our adjoining rooms-first hiccup only one child bed but that was easily remedied-the children were each given a toy cat-nice touch.. The rooms are lovely- warm and spotless of course with loads of fluffy towels and interesting toiletries-the bathrooms were huge! There isn't time to list all the ways in which the concierge service helped us-they were amazing directing us to perfectly acceptable eating places nearby, booking tickets and generally making sure that we wanted for nothing. Also amazing was the service-I had to do a double take when I saw a man in a tail coat making the morning tea-he was the butler. A small birthday treat had been arranged but when it didn't materialise the apology included a bottle of champagne! I don't suppose I'll ever stay there again but what I would say is if you do get the chance to go don't be intimidated-go for it. Well done all at The Savoy-a reputation very well deserved-now where's that lottery ticket!",Leeds England,5/14/2013
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Very good hotel in the City,Very good hotel when travelling for business. Staff friendly. rooms are Clean and the bathroom was pretty big.

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Amazing 5 star hotel!,"Just came back from a marvelous stay at Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park. Everything was perfect, from the warm reception to the quick check out. | Congratulations to all staff members, which were extremely helpful and cared for our every need. We had a room upgrade, which was very thoughtful of them, and stayed at a room with a view to Knightsbridge and not only was the decoration beautiful, but organization and cleaning were also spot on. | The hotel location is also superb, just a few steps from Knightsbridge tube station and Harvey Nichols. Harrods is also just around the corner. | Make sure to try one of their restaurants as well. My fiancé and I booked a table at Bar Boulud and the food was exceptional! | We had an amazing time in London and staying at Mandarin Oriental only enhanced the experience. We shall most definitely come back in our next visit to London!","Sao Paulo, SP",11/19/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,"Excellent location, great staff",Based at the Mondrian for 2 days on business. The rooms were excellent and the staff courteous and helpful. A special mention to Amy and the rest of the concierge team for their local insight and things to do! A great clientele to mix with after work | Highly recommended,"Colwyn Bay, United Kingdom",2/16/2016
Ridgemount Hotel,4,Great value in perfect location,"This is a cosy hotel. The rooms are small (read tiny) and not the most modern, but spotlessly clean. The location is good, service friendly and helpful. Breakfast is all right and wifi is free of charge (reception could be better, though). I'd warmly recommend this hotel to anyone who just wants a decent place to stay.","Lund, Sweden",4/5/2011
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Eccellente,"In tutto, dalla struttura nuova in stile moderno, alla dotazione di tutti i comfort, al personale gentilissimo, professionale e molto disponibile. Elevato livello di pulizia, bagno pulitissimo e completo ( vasca + doccia) di generose dimensioni. Unica pecca la scarsa insonorizzazione della camera, in particolare della porta di accesso. | Il quartiere è molto tranquillo,nei fine settimana poco frequentato,ma si popola negli altri giorni. | La posizione è comodissima, ci sono ben quattro fermate della metro nel raggio di cinquecento metri. Ottimi anche i collegamenti di superficie. Liverpool station ( per chi arriva da Stansted in bus) dista soli cinque minuti a piedi. | Sempre a piedi si raggiungono facilmente London e Tower Bridge. | Maxpar64",NA,4/30/2013
The Savoy,5,Superior in every respect,"There is good reason for The Savoy Hotel attracting the reputation of superiority that they do. They are committed to excellence in every aspect of their hospitality. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel welcome, important and that nothing is too much trouble. The decor is comfortable and suitably English, plus their location cannot be faulted for convenience. Certainly to be recommended.","Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa",7/24/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Excellent hotel all round,"Have stayed many times before and keep coming back. Best value for money I can find in London and very attentive and helpful staff. Free steam room in the spa is very nice and open good hours. Breakfast is amazing and available until 11am weekdays I think, which is nice for a lie in. Location is brilliant - close to stations we use a lot (Blackfriars, Southwark and Waterloo) and love the short stroll to South Bank and everything around there. | Also big thanks to the staff for helping me retrieve something I'd accidentally left in the room - I called them when I realised at the airport and they rushed to the room, got a taxi to drive over and deliver it to me at the terminal in super quick time! | Excellent cot for our 4 month old baby too!",NA,7/4/2016
The Dorchester,2,Disappointing ...,"Having tried the Dorchester hotel in LA and Paris and was very satisfied, I decided to give it try at the iconic Dorchester in London, and what a disappointment. I booked a deluxe king bed room, 2 categories above the standard room, and I was given a room facing a big air conditioning unit and the room was designed for handicapped guests. My request to change the room was rejected till the following day when I made a fuss that they agreed to change the room, and was moved to a smaller room overlooking the air conditioning unit from the 3rd floor :) ... The description in the room on the web site clearly indicated that a deluxe king should be facing Mayfair or the Park. This a deceiving description, and most certainly this property is not good value for money and for the budget better stay at the four season next door.","Muscat, Oman",6/8/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Visit 3 July,"Very modern hotel but not as garish as we had feared. Superb views from the higher floors, as long as you don't mind lots of cranes and building-sites mixed in with the river, St Pauls and the Shard. Room (superior double) was big and ultra comfortable and clean, with very good facilities, and extremely quiet. Service was excellent when we arrived - quick and friendly check-in, our car whisked away for overnight parking very efficiently, luggage delivered promptly, and not a hint of staff hanging about for a tip. Had a meal in the restaurant (Sea Containers), very good and unusual menu and good service and you can sit in the open and watch the river. Next morning was a different story. Had to stand in a queue for check-out at 10.30, which was long before the final check-out time of noon. Then tried to have coffee with friends in the restaurant. It wasn't busy but still took nearly an hour to extract 4 coffees and a snack from staff who didn't seem interested - we had to keep going hunting for staff to get any service and for some reason the coffees came in two stages with 15 minutes between.",NA,7/5/2015
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Good hotel but bad bed,"Very nice hotel in good location. We stayed on a Saturday night so both the hotel and surrounding area were very quiet. Just about 5 minutes walk from Liverpool street and Moorgate stations. Very friendly reception staff. Rooms lovely smallish but very clean and with good facilities including a rubber duck! My one complaint was the bed which was beyond firm - very hard, no give at all just like sleeping on a plank of wood. This was a shame as we didn't get a restful night. Otherwise I'd recommend the hotel.",Essex,2/15/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,3,Where is the Wow Factor?,"We stayed here for 3 nights and was expecting it to be 'Wow' but must say I was disappointed. Last time we were in London we stayed at The Soho Hotel which we were very impressed with and thought this hotel would be of a similar standard. sadly it was not.We had a room over looking the Thames, the room was clean and the bed comfortable but found the decor uninteresting, very little hanging space,the bathroom was an average size . The service we received on checkin was good but found the service in the restaurant where we had breakfast to be lacking. Constantly trying to catch there eye for service, all seemed to be wandering around doing everything but giving service. One morning the toaster was not working asked one of the guys he did not know how to work it and walked away. Repeatedly I would ask for my flat white coffee to be extra hot never was and gave up. There is no black pepper on the table only salt which I found odd always had to ask for it when I questioned it I was told not enough room on the table!!!! My cup one morning had a chip in it. For this standard of hotel not good enough. We had drinks in the bar one night if you wanted any nuts or chips to nibble on you had to pay for them the drinks were pricey enough add an extra few pence to all the drinks and supply chips or nuts you might find in the end people will stay and in the long run spend more. I did bring these things to the attention of management and in fairness they did send a lovely bottle of wine and cheese to our room with a note of apology. This is not a cheap hotel and expected much more sadly next time in London we will choose a different hotel.","Perth, Australia",9/4/2015
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Ottimo,E stata la nostra prima volta in questo albergo che ci ha lasciati molto soddisfatti. Ideale la posizione con metropolitana vicina.

The Rembrandt,5,Great Stay in London,My 80 year old mother wanted to got London and I picked the Rembrandt. | It has a great location close to the South Kensington Metro stop. | The staff is very helpful and they have a great breakfast buffet to start your day. | I have stayed at the Rembrandt three time now and never been dissapointed.,"Lexington, Kentucky",5/21/2012
Corinthia Hotel London,4,A Fabulous Treat!,"Stayed here for my birthday and it was wonderful! The staff were excellent and even prepared a birthday cake and card for me. The room (upgraded to a junior suite) was one of the best I've stayed in. Great location for theatres (reason for our visit) and restaurants. We ate in late in their restaurant that night, food was excellent. Great night's sleep and great breakfast the next day. Would highly reccommend!","London, United Kingdom",4/3/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Great value South Bank Sunday package,"My husband and I booked the South Bank Sunday package which included dinner for two, the room and breakfast buffet for a really good price, especially considering that this is a 5* hotel located right on the Thames. We were able to check in early as our room was available which was really handy as we wanted to drop our bags off before heading into the west end. | We booked a standard city view room which was very well appointed and overlooked the London Eye. The hotel is newly opened so everything in the room, as well as the rest of the hotel, was pristine. The room itself was pretty sizeable for a standard room and had a lovely grey marbled bathroom with luxury sixed Malin &amp; Goetz toiletries. The bed was very comfortable and although we didn't have anything, the mini bar was very well stocked. | Downstairs in the basement there is a 24hr fitness centre which my husband used at 6am and a spa. Treatments for the spa are bookable in advance and I would advise doing so as there was no availability on the day when I asked. There are single sex steam rooms and also a spa lounge where you can sit and relax, no pool or jacuzzi unfortunately. | There is direct access from the hotel onto the South Bank and the Sea Containers restaurant and Dandelyan bar offer superb people watching opportunities. | We were very impressed with the Mondrian and will certainly visit again.","Cambridge, United Kingdom",7/27/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,"Different, Great Location, Great Interior","Stayed here for a work event. The whole hotel has has quirky decor. Staff are very friendly. The rooms are large and stunning. We didn't have a bath, but the shower was fantastic.

The Rembrandt,3,Could be so much better,Visited for a 2 night stay rooms were ok but not plush and we had booked an executive room rang twice for beverage replenishment and never came.sat in the bar in the evening only serve 175ml wine can't get 250ml ordered ice cream only vanilla strawberry left! The hotel had a wedding on Saturday so limited service and on Sunday evening no restaurant service at all stayed at the Rubens prev much better in all aspects for same deal price with secret escapes.what a shame as location good | So much choice of hotels so why not strive to be excellent,"Mansfield, United Kingdom",3/20/2017
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Très sympathique,Nous avons séjourné à 4 pour le pont de l Ascension au Ridgemount Hotel en mai 2016. C est un petit hôtel très sympathique idéalement situé tout près du British Museum. Nous avons presque tout fait à pied. Nous sommes venus de saint Pancras jusqu'à l hôtel à pied également. La famille qui gère l hôtel est charmante. L accueil parfait. La chambre a 4 est plutôt grande et très propre (seul bémol nous étions côté rue Gower et il y a beaucoup de circulation). Le petit déjeuner est copieux. Bref nous avons passé 4 jours super! Prix correct pour Londres (160 livres par nuit pour 4 personnes). À conseiller !,NA,5/19/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Excellent hotel but make sure you book to use the bar area in advance,A fabulous hotel in a fantastic location. It is directly next to the Oxo Tower and near to Blackfriars Bridge. Staff were very friendly and the rooms were clean fresh and nice. One thing I would say is the standard room which our friends have is perfect. It is not worth upgrading for £50 per night for a better town view. | We were disappointed when we arrived to be told we could not use the bars as they were all fully booked as the restaurant allows bookings and use for non hotel guests. So that was very disappointing. My advice would be to ensure if you want to sit down and have a drink make sure you book in advance. | A review on here suggested for breakfsats try the local Tate Gallery. Dont do that. The worst breakfast we have ever had. | In summary would 100% use the hotel again but would pre book the use of the bars. If we did not have this issue would have rated 5 stars,"London, United Kingdom",4/26/2018
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",4,Superbreak Stay,"My partner and I booked to stay at the Xenia through Superbreak, along with theatre tickets to see Billy Elliot. A very good choice! When arriving at the hotel, check-in was smooth and the room was available straight away although we checked in early. The helpful doorman showed us to the lift, he didn't explain we needed to swipe our room card in order for the lift to work. When the lift was going nowhere and it turned dark a slight panic came over us and after pressing the alarm button, the doorman then explained how to use the lift! The hotel smelt clean and fresh and when entering our room first impressions were how cosy it looked. We stayed in a classic double room and it had everything we needed. A lovely clean bathroom with L'occataine toiletries, big fluffy towels, tea and coffee facilities with biscuits and a bottle of water. These are only a few things to mention. The room was quite small but absolutely fine for what we needed. The hotel is in an excellent position, a short walk from Gloucester Road tube station. We had the full breakfast in the morning which you could help yourself to the continental buffet that had a wide variety of food to choose from, fresh food and then our choice off the menu. My partner had a full English breakfast and I had the scrambled egg and smoked salmon on toast. Both were very well presented and possibly the best breakfast we have had. Both of us were very impressed with the hotel and agreed we would definitely stay at the Xenia again. We look forward to it!!","Desborough, United Kingdom",2/9/2014

Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Friendliest staff,"I stayed in this hotel during the ""St Jude's"" storm as friends were getting married in the city. Conveniently located the hotel was in fact a haven of calm with some of the most welcoming, confident and friendly staff I have experienced in a hotel before. | They really made sure we all enjoyed our stay and made the most out of the occasion, even going up to my room on checkout to fetch the complimentary jelly beans as I hadn't discovered them!! I did bring back Wally the rubber duck from the bathroom though for my daughter :-) | The rooms were complimented on by all our group.

Our room was everything I'd hoped for and more! Breakfast was wonderful. I can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and I'll definitely stay again I was so impressed!!",NA,10/4/2015
The Savoy,5,Everything I had hoped for.,"Stayed with my daughter and took advantage of the Sunday night special rate. Contact with the hotel before arrival was first class and from the moment we arrived we were blown away with the quality of the staff and the hotel. The public spaces are fabulous and we loved the museum and the photographs and paintings of past guests that dotted the walls. The American Bar was a lovely place to pass time and to enjoy a couple of cocktails from the extensive menu. Our room was as good as expected - massive bath, the bed was marvellously comfortable and the black-out curtains worked a treat. Breakfast in the Thames Foyer was superb - lovely hot breakfast and great service once again. We treated ourselves to afternoon tea and I am so glad that we did - a couple of relaxing hours in a beautiful setting with as many sandwiches, scones and cakes as you could possibly want. (The scones with clotted cream, lemon curd/homemade strawberry jam were sublime). The pianist that played whilst we ate added to the atmosphere and I would recommend the afternoon tea wholeheartedly. All in all, I would return in a heartbeat and have started saving!",newcastle upon tyne,7/1/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Lovely Birthday treat,"Partner and I decided to book this hotel as a last minute treat for my Birthday. Happy to say was not disappointed in the slightest. Polite staff, spacious room, speedy room service and all round no complaints.. checked in quite late as I was unwell in the daytime but was no issue. Was even provided with 2 free complimentary cocktails to use at one of the bars for my special day. Wish we had got there earlier to explore all the facilities. Will defo return.","London, United Kingdom",1/31/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Beautiful hotel experience,We absolutely loved staying at this hotel. Our room and the bathroom areas were spacious and the external balcony access and area was one of the best features - it was great to sit out and read or have a coffee and watch the world go by. The in-house facilities were excellent and the room décor was modern and well considered. Would not think twice about staying again.,"Hobart, Australia",8/14/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Elegance - great for drinks for business or with family or friends,"Dependable meeting place.

Rhodes Hotel,4,Good place to stay in London,Rhodes Hotel offered good value and excellent service in London. Deluxe double was a worthwhile upgrade and gets you a good sized room in London. Continental Breakfast was a nice addition. Found the staff to be particularly helpful and responsive. | Location is excellent for nearby tube or train station (Paddington) as well as Hyde Park. City centre can be easily walked to in around 1/2 hour,"Calgary, Canada",10/3/2013
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Great Location in the Heart of Knightsbridge,"Beautiful old hotel in the heart of London facing Sloane Street which houses the most upscale shopping in London with ease to many great restaurants, pubs and Harrod's. The restaurants in the hotel for Breakfast and dinner are fantastic. Request a room facing Sloane Street and upgrade to a suite as it is worth the upgrade. It is an older hotel but updated to accomodate modern conveniences.","Montgomery, Alabama",5/30/2014
The Rembrandt,4,Trip to Wimbledon,"I love this hotel! We visit London at least twice a year and I will definitely be staying at this hotel again. It's in a great location, 10 minute walk from Harrods and just around the corner from restaurants and South Kensington. We found it easy to get to and from Wimbledon and Euston. | Staff are great and the rooms are lovely, we had everything we needed at a very reasonable price. Breakfast was really good too. | Only problem I had was that when checking in they very nearly charged me for the two nights, when I had already paid upfront as part of an advance deal. Also they debit your card with £50 for any charges you may have and then credit it back, I've not experienced this before. | Only tip I would suggest is to avoid a room with a connecting door. The couple next door to us the first night were very loud and woke us up twice. | Also next time I will bring my own hairdryer, as the hairdryer is stored in the drawer and the lead was tangled and not long enough for me to dry my hair properly, I just tied it up in the end :-)",Liverpool,7/8/2014
The Savoy,5,Exemplary Service and Stunning Hotel,"The Savoy never fails to impress each time we visit. From the moment we arrived in our car, the door opened and a hand was given to help me out by the doorman (I'm not ancient it just made me feel special!), to the warm welcome back by the reception team. We were celebrating our anniversary and they very kindly upgraded us to a suite overlooking the river and a delicious cake with happy anniversary written in chocolate was ready in our room. Lunch in Kaspers was perfect, before we went to the Shard viewing gallery (which was well worth a visit!) - interesting cocktails in the American bar that evening all served by a truly professional and friendly team. We love this 5 star hotel and all the special touches always make this a memorable experience. Highly recommended and can't wait to return!","Hartpury, United Kingdom",6/17/2015
Rhodes Hotel,4,Petite mais propre/ small but clean,"Laccueil de Panos est simplement Wow! Il vous explique tout et vient même porter votre valise à votre chambre si vous êtes à lannexe. Javais la chambre 330, minuscule environ 11 pieds par 5, mais impeccable! La salle de bain a été rénovée, les planchers aussi dans la chambre, le lit est correct ni trop dur ni trop mou. Il y a une petite table avec une chaise, une télé au bout du lit. La literie est changé à tous les jours. Les escaliers pour sy rendre sont dangereuses et étroites. Cependant, elles sont correctes pour les chambres du niveau 320. Javais une chambre côté cours et e nai pas été réveillée par le bruit des voitures. Ce doit être plus bruyant du côté rue. Le déjeuner se prend à lhôtel principal à 5 minutes de marches au sous-sol, celui qui sen occupe veille à ce quil ne manque de rien (fromage, jambon, croissant, céréales, nutella, confiture et beurre darachides, fruits). Lhôtel est hyper bien situé à 7 minutes de marche de Paddington. Si je reviens à Londres, il est certain que je reviens à cet hôtel, ce nest pas le grand luxe, mais rapport qualité/prix cest top! | Encore merci à Panos qui a fait de mon séjour, un séjour incroyable! | I was sleeping at the annex, the service of Panos was incredible! He bring me luggage to my room and explain everything. Ive got the room 330; the stairs are dangerous but hold the ramp and its ok! Also it was very small 11 by 5 feet, but the bathroom is new as the floor. The stairs that go to the rooms of level 320 are ok. Its very clean and the litery is change every day. If you have a room make sure that is not on the street because its noisy. Mine was on the back and i slept very well. | For breakfast you have to walk 5 minutes, but for me it was ok, the man who is in charge make sure that everyone is happy and that you have everything. There is ham, cheese, croissant, bread, nutella, peanut butter and gelly. Also some fruits. | 7 minutes walk from paddington, so very well located. | If I come back to London fore sure I will be back. Very good price for what you got! | Thanks again to Panos who make my stay incredible!","Montreal, Canada",5/1/2018
The Savoy,5,Wow....,"The hotel is pure luxury at every level... I booked this hotel as a surprise birthday present for my partner for his 50th birthday. The hotel had made a cake for him and 'The Gordon Ramsay Grill' had also baked him a cake... We finished the evening in 'The American bar with cocktails...' Had breakfast this morning over looking the Thames...The staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for you... The room was fantastic, even the television had a welcome message on it..

The Savoy,5,Absolutely Amazing Stay,"This hotel is by far the best I have ever stayed at. The room was spectacular and the staff was the most amazing I have ever seen. We were greeted by Margot at the front desk and she really made us feel welcome. We dined at the Savoy Grill, Thames Hall, and Kaspar's. All three venues were incredible. Athina in the Thames Grill was by far the best hotel representative I have ever met in all my travels. She went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Fairmont should be very proud to have her. We will be returning very soon!","New York City, New York",8/2/2017
"Bulgari Hotel, London",5,anything you dream,"You can get anything you want. yes it's like in alice's restaurant, but more more luxury. bulgari hotel in london is a great news (very close to hyde park and harrod's in knightsbridge). i was ther ealone in the second week of june and i had a main room, better than al lot of suite where i'v been. bed gorgeous and a lot of of sweeties ideas. spa fantastic (you can forget the world when you are in the green or in the the golden pool. breakfast and food good for an important hotel. bulgari will be my first choice in london.",milano,7/15/2012
The Dorchester,5,lost for words,We stayed for one night and I must admit when we arrived we were expecting nothing as goods as the savoy where we normally stay. But the place is so much more relaxing and friendly and the promenade is probably the best breakfast experience I have ever had. Only downside would be the prices as some a little kick in the teeth and also we felt really uncomfortable at the cocktail bar at the end of the promoenade as a lovely couple turned up (1 was blind !!) and as they were not dressed as well as other folk the bartender really turned his nose up and made a point that this bar is £20 for non guest min spend. I really do hope the management read this as the lady was a guest of your hotel and had to find her key which really made her feel very embarrased including me I these are the basics in service and that is why I mark you down 2 stars. Staff at such a nice hotel should never judge clients whatever they are dressed like in my opinion. She was even blind with a stick my busienss would be closed if I judged every phone call and meeting!!. Overall though this is just one member of staff and I would seriously recommend and will be staying again very soon. Oh and finally I would recommend seeing the live music near the cocktail bar as this was just sublime and they even mentioned my wifes name in the songs after I tipped them.,lciester,5/14/2012

Apex London Wall Hotel,5,excellent hotel,"stayed here in august 2010 and would definitely recommend it. | i found the staff to be very helpful. room service was very good. transport to other parts of london is easy as moorgate and liverpool st stations are both short walks away. | the room itself (117) was very good, with a very comfortable king size bed, chaise longue, 40"" sharp lcd tv, tolomeo desk and bedside lamps. bathroom had a huge bath and double-size walk in shower, anti-steam mirror etc. the outlook from the first floor room was not attractive, but i wasn't staying here for the view from the window. | there is very little immediately surrounding the hotel except for offices and shops for office workers that are closed on the weekend. as a result, it was very quiet the weekend i stayed, which is what i wanted.","London, United Kingdom",8/31/2010
The Rembrandt,5,"Excellent Stay at The Rembrandt: Location, Comfort, Service","I'm a few months overdue in posting about our November stay at The Rembrandt, but I had to share a review on this wonderful hotel. My husband and I traveled to the UK to attend our friends' civil ceremony in Yorkshire, and we decided to add a week's stay in London as a vacation/belated birthday celebration. We wanted someplace centrally located, reasonably priced, and with great amenities -- and The Rembrandt delivered on all counts. | The hotel is just a short walk from the South Kensington Tube station (turn right out of the turnstiles, follow the passageway, and take the first V&amp;A exit), which made it a perfect base for exploring the city. While it's easy to get just about anywhere in London via the South Kens Tube, there are plenty of great drinking and dining options nearby; we tried several local restaurants (Thai Square, Khan's of Kensington, Kwality Indian, Le Pain Quotidien) and enjoyed pints at our ""local"", The Hoop &amp; Toy, and wine tasting at The Sampler. And the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) is just across the road! I should add that we always felt safe walking through the neighborhood, even late at night. | As for the hotel itself, we found the staff to be very kind and welcoming. I contacted the hotel before our arrival with a few questions and mentioned that our visit was in part a birthday celebration; customer service specialist Lesley Denyer was very incredibly helpful, offering all kinds of recommendations and noting our special occasion. Upon our arrival, during the friendly and efficient check-in process, we were thrilled to discover that we had been upgraded to an executive room (#547). | Our accommodations were very comfortable, nicely decorated, and quite roomy by London standards. The marble bath was lovely, and we appreciated the full tub/shower with good water pressure. The room included a comfy bed, desk, closet with safe, chairs, table, and bathrobes; and our windows overlooked a quiet residential area (we could also see the dome of the V&amp;A). The hotel provided Gilchrist &amp; Soames bath amenities, including a conditioning shampoo, body wash, body lotion, and a very small hand soap. (If you prefer using a separate shampoo and conditioner or bath soap rather than body wash, you may want to bring your own.) We loved our room; the only (very minor) issue we experienced is that it occasionally smelled a bit damp/musty when we returned after a day of sightseeing -- most likely due to the rainy weather during our visit. But I was able to open the windows to allow some fresh air in, and the faint musty odor immediately dissipated. | Our room rate included the breakfast buffet, which was tasty and had good variety. Hot items included eggs, baked beans, mushrooms, and meats (I don't recall what kind, as I'm vegetarian and didn't eat any). Other offerings included bread/baked goods (croissants, danishes, etc.), cereal, yogurt, fruit, cheese, juices, and more. The waitstaff brought individual coffee and/or tea pots to each table. | Overall, we had an outstanding stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Rembrandt; I definitely plan to stay here during our next trip to London. Yes, it's an older building; so rooms may vary in size, shape, and setup. But the accommodations, service, location, and value for money can't be beat!","Austin, Texas",2/21/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Great hotel and super location,"Hotel was a pleasant surprise. Rooms large for London. Service and concierge very good.

The Rembrandt,4,A perfect base,"Had a great two night visit to The Rembrandt. Not much to fault with it really, good quiet location (for London) ideal for sight seeing, theatres and shopping. We initially booked this hotel for the spa facilities but were so in the city busy we didn't get a chance to even look at it. Breakfast was not the usual continental style but extensive with lots of choice- it really set us up for the day. A most enjoyable stay.",Chester,5/29/2010
The Rembrandt,5,short break,"This hotel is in a great position , just opposite the Albert and Victoria museum, and round the corner from Kensington tube station. ALL the staff were so helpful and friendly, it was so nice to be treated like you were more than just a paying guest,the room we had was really clean and well prepared, the only fault ,,the whirlpool bath didnt work, but if we had reported it I'm sure it would have been fixed. service at reception, the bar and at breakfast were excellent and we never felt rushed even though it was busy, food was well prepared and presented and included hot, cold, cereals, toast, fruit and hot and cold drinks.Would we visit again? This will be our hotel of choice whenever we visit London, the place is a gem!!!",scarborough,1/17/2012
Rhodes Hotel,4,Comfortable and friendly,"Easy to find, Lancaster Gate tube short walk away. Local shop and eateries. Friendly staff. Recently refurbished: evident new decor, new comfortable mattresses, fridge and en suite shower &amp; toilet. Rooms had controllable air con and heating (a must with 2 teenage boys!). Continental breakfast, plenty of it, though you can purchase full English. I will chose this hotel again.",Merseyside,2/23/2013
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",4,Solid addition to Autograph name,"Stayed at the Hotel Xenia for work. Not too far from the Earls Court tube station and minutes from cool shopping on the 74 bus line. Room was small but appreciated as it was nicely appointed. But I can easily see how this ""upgraded"" room could be a problem for many- the door to the bathroom cannot open all the way into the room and there is limited space to store your gear. But for a business traveler who ended up sick the hotel was greatly appreciated. Good AC, quiet room, excellent hotel food. Was a nice place to rest and work. Felt like I was treated well. | I would caution you to check your reservations before arrival. I had an error where my reservation was indicated as a no show even though I called the hotel directly to shift the entire trip one day later. Seems there must be confusion between the hotel's system and the Marriott online system and mobile app. It was resolved for me, but resulted in many extra costs due to room rates no longer being available. A little frustrating, but assume these things will be worked out over time.","Carlsbad, California",9/17/2016
Rhodes Hotel,4,Cheap comfortable one night stay around from Hyde Park,"We had a work party around Paddington and wanted somewhere to have a shower, get changed and crash later for the night. I booked a double room for around 59 pounds on a Friday night. Good value for money as a continental breakfast was included too. The location is easily accessible from Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations although it's currently behind temporary fencing of Crossrail construction work. So one has to walk around either side of the fencing to get to number 195. Check in was quick, the staff helpful and friendly. I mistakenly booked 2 singles and asked to change to a double and was offered one in another building that is part of the hotel. Room was clean, warm with a lovely comfy bed. There was a shower with gel provided and a hair dryer too. Lots of clean and fresh towels. | A word of caution to any person with accessibility issues: the rooms are spread over 4 floors but there is no lifts and if you are accommodation is that the annexe, you have to go to the other building for breakfast. I didn't find these issues off putting at all due to the excellent location of this place with plenty of good restaurants and local shops around. Plus Hyde park is around the corner!","London, United Kingdom",3/15/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,5,A Gem-Off the Radar. Best Hotel,"First I want to apologize to the hotel in my delay and slack in writing this review. Got Home and Life just happens..No excuses just WOW OH WOW..I wanted to give the Hotel and the review the time it deserves-They are more then 7 stars.They sure were not slack in there service,hospitality and open arms welcoming.(you will see I am kinda a dramatic gurl-LOL | This is a wonderful Hotel,the pictures do not ---I repeat ---do not do it even come close to doing the hotel justice! I am hoping my pictures will help with that-you be the judge! | The Hotels sheer designer opulence and attention to detail is remarkable. I also want to say I read all reviews before booking here. | Some were umm emmm well ---a little less complimentary-I dont know why. I hope you will all think twice and stay here over some where else! | The staff, I swear must have to answer a secret question only they know. For what I mean by this,is that they all are there to help you have AN UNBELIEVABLE STAY!!!! And I do mean unbelievable stay. | The whole staff and I do mean all the staff from Concierge,Front Desk greeters to the Door Man to the Porters(who I might say if you are from the states 1 of them looks just like a young version of Christian Slater was soo sweet ran down the street got taxis when it took to long or was raining,he took pics for us) The one Door man who is from Ireland gave us suggestions where to go as this was our 2nd leg of the trip. We were going to the Notre Dame Game there.To the cleaning staff,as I smoke(oh there is no smoking in the rooms or in hotel)however there is a lovely courtyard that is built between the hotel walls that you may smoke a cig or cigar. Lovely fireplaces at each end and you may also order sandwiches or tea. To the restaurant servers at Massimos the Head Receiptionist Oonagha,to Maxime the Asst Manager who waited on us. | Everyone and I do mean everyone from the Concierges with Darren, Justin and Sebastian, to the Front Desk Ben Milsom Reservations Supervisor. He helped with the car service(we chose a JaguarXJ cost of £140 from the service of"" Quintessentially""(please ask for Mark07738971555) and the initial reservation. | Our room was unbelievable a deluxe room,a lovely chocolate confection cake to celebrate our 1st trip to london and more. He made it all so special with champagne,which was waiting for us in the room. To Jean Louis Fresta -Front of House Manager to Julius Asst front desk supervisor. We had a slight problem with the first room heated floors(which seem to be standard in all rooms) not working.(Oh yes the hotel has free yes free wifi and it worked in our room along with the one we switched to! )They tried to fix the problem but were unable to with out major work in house.They were very courteous as they wont enter your room if you have DND light on or are not there and have not spoken to you to enter. If you read the review you will see I am trying to point out what others seem to find fault with where we DID NOT. | Also the closet was huge in this standard room. Not be able to fix this they offered to move us from room #726 deluxe to room #321 which was a beautiful suite. | The room was excellently appointed in decoration. There are 2 rooms a small hallway and 1 full bathroom along with a entry hallway with a guest bath as we did entertain while there we did biz and pleasure. I loved the room with its accessories books to read Chanel and more all for the guests enjoyment. I must mention I loved the makeup table with mirror drawers so chic! | I also want to say we didnt even need to leave the hotel if we chose not to. | The brkfst was lawesome, so many choices to choose from.Breads eggs sausage bacon ceral fresh fruit yogart I think you get it. You could also see a menu if you didnt want the continental Breakfast. This served breakfast and lunch tea can be had in the wonderful hotel lobby which really isnt a hotel lobby like we think of in the states. Dinner can be had at Massimos yumme yumme italian and a French Restaruant which we did not eat there. The spa which was phenomenal along with a work out room,lots of water and use of certain spa amenities. | WOW OH WOW Thank You to Renaud Gregoire who I also had the pleasure to meet. He enables his staff to take care of the situation-get it handled make the customer happy! | I am sure if you are reading this you can see how much we loved this hotel. I hope you read this in its entirety,Yes I do go on and on...When a hotel deserves this recognition it should be lengthy. | We have stayed all over in mostly 6+ star/Diamond etc Hotels from California to Hawaii to Rome Cavalieri Hotel. This is the Jewel of all! | Once you read this review please contact me if you have any questions. | We loved it so much we are going back in November --yes just 2 short months later.. | I just didnt want to leave ever. | When we first arrived our stay was originally for 3 days, we extended our stay from 3 days to 4 more for a total of 7days---still not long enough! | Please realize you are in Europe and if you are from the states things/matters do run a little differently here.There is a hierarchy so know they do want to help you but must get the all ok from higher....Please treat the hotel and staff with courtesy (No I don't work here or for any hotel affiliation with them or any Hotel for that matter) .If there is a blip with your reservation or room just be patient. | There are so many people from the Hotel to say ""Thank You"" to. I hope you will show this to your staff Mr Dixion. | Thank You to you and all your staff for making our trip to LONDON so unbelievable we already have reservations for November 18th to 24th-confirmed! | Sincerely | With Warm Regards | Natalya Lisa","Chicago, Illinois",10/8/2012
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",5,Amazing jazz dinner experience,"We spent there about 3 hours jazz live music dinner in a discreet light and super romantic surroundings. Staff was great, attentive to our needs. We were on a 5 course meal, food was great! Italian dinning style. Definitely an experience never to forget!","London, United Kingdom",7/19/2018
The Savoy,5,POSH!,"I stayed at the Savoy March 2-5 and had a lovely stay. The hotel is steeped in history(pics of celeb guests of yesteryear, Kaspar the 14th guest cat who rounds up unlucky dinner parties of 13, lovely art and antique elevators), amazing bars and lounges....I highly recommend a visit to the American Bar, and the best tea in London. Sadly my husband fell ill while visitng but the Savoy called a doctor and arranged for an in room visit. Luckily he felt better quickly and we were able to take advantage of all the fantastic amenities, the perfect location and fantastic service of this very special place. Ironically ten years prior to our stay when we were in a much different financial bracket we had tea at the Savoy with dreams of staying one day....it lived up to every expectaion! Cheers!",new York,3/15/2013
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Our Mondrian hotel stay was our best ever stay in a London hotel,"We spent a long time choosing three different hotels to which to stay in,in London on our three day celebration of my 50th birthday and we were so pleased that it was the Mondrian that we chose for my big day, from the minute we checked in the staff were friendly, trendy and very polite. They had taken note that it was a special day for us and that was how they made us feel, a bottle of wine was sent to our very modern room that had a view of the Thames and the city as we were on the 15th floor with a message of congratulations. We were so impressed with the hotel and staff that we changed our plans for our evening meal and chose to try the restaurant on the ground floor and was not disappointed with the lovely meal and once again the fantastic staff. we eventually left the hotel to spend time in London","Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom",4/29/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Little bit of LA on The Thames,"Just stayed in room 582, fab view of the Thames, very stylish, super comfy bed and amazing bathroom. Staff were absolutely amazing, just the right amount of friendliness, efficiency and service. rumpus Room bar is awesome, with mazing views and best sound system heard in ages. Breakfast at Sea Containers was great, dinner featured the best burger and triple cooked chips ever had. only downside was dinner menu was limited on the choice front. Definately recommend staying if you don't want to be in the heart of the city but still within very easy walk of all the south bank culture.","London, England, United Kingdom",10/19/2014
London Guest House,5,Great staff,Rooms were a good value and the staff was excellent. They were very accomodating and helped us in a number of ways. I would be happy spending another weekend in london with them. A good nights sleep is priceless.,NA,3/14/2018
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,OMG the view!,"This is the super modern, super chic, brand new Mondrian in London. It is a gorgeous and fun representation of the brand, with all the amenities and incredible art that makes it a truly special place. The decor is edgy yet comfortable, and Americans visiting can look forward to US outlets in the walls and well as USB ports and various other power outlets. The standing tub is a luxury and such a nice treat. The only downside is that everything is a bit of a walk. If you don't mind it, you are about 15 minutes walk to Waterloo tube station. There are some pubs and a nando's a bit closer. The location's highlight is obviously being right on the Thames. If you are lucky enough to afford a balcony suite it is a unique and special London experience I would recommend to those who love the city! Also very near to the London Eye and the Tate Modern.The staff here are really cool and polite, and provide a very relaxing atmosphere.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",12/8/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Birthday two-nighter,"We stayed here for two nights to celebrate Tina's birthday and it was pretty damn superb. Let's split things into helpful boxes: | Location: You really can't beat it on this. Right in the middle of London, literally by the side of the Thames (we had breakfast right by the path), right next to the South Bank area. Blackfriars tube/rail is a very short walk away, Covent Garden is about 20 minutes walk. | Rooms: we had a studio room on the sixth floor, not overlooking the river sadly (it's a fair chunk extra for that) but the room itself was excellent. Spacious, stylish, filled with interesting features (I particularly appreciated the lights that just dim until they go dark, with no audible 'click'. It's the little things sometimes) and a giant bed that was satisfyingly firm. The bathroom would possibly not be to everyone's taste but it was very swish and roomy and slick. | The hotel itself: you've probably seen pictures already, but it's ridiculously well done. Unique and impressive all over the place. | Food: we had room service in bed one morning, then breakfast in the restaurant another, and on both occasions it would be very difficult to find fault with the food. It's obviously not cheap (£22 each for the restaurant buffet breakfast, for instance) but come on, fresh salmon? And scrambled eggs better than you'll get served up on request at many restaurants... plus, as mentioned, the location is spectacular and that's partly what you pay for. | Other things: I put in an order for a birthday cake to be made and left our room before we arrived, and I'll upload a picture of it. All I'll say is that it was a truly exceptional cake, and I'm confident that it'll be in my top three pretty much forever. | Also we used the gym, which was better than a lot of hotels and had a good range of dumbbells, kettlebells, and a chinning bar. There were also treadmills but come on people, you're on the Thames! Get out there and run. We also were guided through the spa complex to get to the gym, and that was much like I imagine walking through a spaceship might be. | So to sum up, obviously it's an expensive hotel, but in this case you really do get what you pay for. A birthday treat to remember for a long time to come.","Sandbach, United Kingdom",7/21/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,5 star service in a 5 Star location,"I loved my stay at Mondrian London its modern and beautifully sleek with a location that is PERFECT for trips to Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe and The National Theatre. The view from the riverside rooms is a truly picturesque London! | I will also add that DANDELYAN is a world class cocktail bar. Their very helpful barman made a lover at first sip of the Boulevardier cocktail which was not in my drinking vocabulary. | The hotel ""gets"" first class service which is down I think to their wonderful staff who were extraordinarily helpful . I have already booked my next stay.","Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom",11/25/2016

Rhodes Hotel,4,What a find,"We were advised that we would be in the annex round the corner when we made the original booking but asked if we could stay in the actual hotel. Room was small but very clean, showerroom could be described as small to tiny not recommended for the larger | figure. Chris and his wife were fantastic hosts, shame there isn't a bar in the hotel | to meet other guests but plenty of eating and drinking places near by. Did lots of travelling | by underground and two stations within 10 minutes of the hotel. Also easy to catch the open top bus and in walking distance of all main attractions.

Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Fab!,I would highly recommend this as it's so convenient....Mary Poppins was being filmed there. Lots of bars but very quiet on a Saturday as everything was closed . Close to all amenities. Lovely hotel overall.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",3/13/2017
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,"Overall enjoyable stay, would recommend","We stayed here for 2 nights (friday and saturday), having booked a deal through secret escapes. We were pleasantly surprised to be told we'd been upgraded to a deluxe room on arrival, which had a really spacious bathroom. We were also impressed with the complimentary items in the room, the complimentary newspaper of our choice and the free hire of films. The staff were really friendly and helpful and lent us an umbrella when it was raining. The location was convenient as it was a couple of minutes' walk to liverpool street and bank stations. We enjoyed our continental breakfast (which was included, although we could have upgraded to a full breakfast for only £5), especially as it was served until 11am which suited us better than some other places as we like to sleep! Also, checkout was at midday which was also good and there was no problem in leaving our luggage with the hotel after we checked out before going home.","Ipswich, United Kingdom",2/13/2013
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Top Hotel,"Been to many of top hotels in London and this runs along side the best of them.

The Savoy,5,Just fabulous,"Second time for us at the Savoy and did not disappoint. Had a king room which was spacious and clean. Breakfast was amazing with nice views over the Thames. What makes the Savoy different than other similar rated hotels is the staff. They really do their best to look after you, are down to earth and a friendly bunch. Looking forward to our next London trip...need to save a little extra for the Savoy but well worth it.",NA,11/19/2017
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,5,Best I have expierenced in London,From the time we were met to when we left we had a first class expierence. The suite had everything one could ask for. The serivce in Cut and the room service was first class.The staff were all friendly and professional.,Monaco,9/20/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,My new London favorite,"I travel regularly and London is often part of those plans. Over the years I have tired a number of hotels all over the capital but have to say that the Mondrian is above and beyond my current favorite! And even better comes at a reasonable price. | It's location cannot be beat. Directly on the south bank it actively encourages you to walk around the city with The City, Southwark/London Bridge, Waterloo/Westminster, Covent Garden all within a 20-30 minute walk. I work in the London Bridge area and love starting the day with a walk down the south bank passing Tate Modern, Shakespear's Globe, Southwark Cathedral... the list goes on (not to mention the Instagram post). | The hotel is clean, well organized and I have always found the staff helpful and welcoming. Some may find the décor and overall ambiance a little on the 'trendy' side but it is not as in-you-face as other brands so never caused me an issue. The rooms are a decent size for London with comfortable beds, a reasonable sized desk/work area and all the other amenities you'd expect. I've particular loved the Handy phones available in the room which provide free access to local calls, key information and even some mobile apps for the guest. These phones can be taken outside the hotel and are a great help for the disorientated traveler. | I have had a number of good meals at the attached restaurant, Sea Containers, and although I have not stayed over a weekend I hear that their weekend brunch is one of the best in London! I always make at least one trip to what has recently been awarded as the world's best cocktail bar; Dandelyan, which does a great array of different cocktails and you can find some good food too - Ploughman's for me! | Overall a very nice hotel hotel, excellent location and all round great service warrant five stars and it's place as one of the top hotels in London.","Cleveland, Ohio",8/10/2017
The Rembrandt,4,Stayed at the Rembrandt,Just got back from a week at the Rembrandt Hotel. Overall the visit was pleasant. | Was very disappointed that there was no washcloths in the room and had to call for them almost daily. Also I thought the lobby should have a phone to call up to guests. Had to use the front desk phone when needed. I thought the breakfast was great except if you weren't down by nine in the morning they were out of fresh fruit. The front desk was very pleasant and helpful. The bathrooms were a ways from the lobby or bar area.,"Canton, Michigan",4/14/2015
Ridgemount Hotel,4,Cheap and Basic,"The Ridgemount Hotel is basic and cheap. If you expect more than that, then you will be disappointed. You definitely will not find a hotel this cheap in Bloomsvury. On the whole, the hotel feels worn and a little rundown, but everything worked. Free wi-fi was a definitely plus. I had a single room with shared bath. The room itself was very clean and had a sink and TV. The bathrooms and toilets down the hall were also very clean. My only complaint was that the windows did not do a good job blocking the noise from Gower Street.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",6/25/2009
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Fabulous,Lovely hotel and beautifully decorated . Great location but most importantly fabulous staff .... Couldn't be more helpful . Thank you .

Corinthia Hotel London,5,A Fantastic Experience!,"Spent my birthday weekend at this lovely hotel, everything from the moment we checked in to the moment we sadly leaved the hotel has been truly amazing! The hotel is stunning, having afternoon tea in the lobby under the lovely chandelier is a must do! The room is great and we had a huge bathroom! The staff is truly attentive and always try to predict our needs and will go far and beyond to make sure we have a great time. Finally the SPA, it is by far the best hotel SPA I have ever been to, it is huge and just by walking in you already feel relaxed! | I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in London and wanting a true luxurious and relaxed stay!",NA,7/3/2017
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Gutes Hotel nahe Ubahn,"Wir hatten das Hotel für ein Wochenende in London gebucht. Das Hotel liegt in einem Bankenviertel, abends ist dort nicht mehr so viel los, bzw. Sonntags haben dort die meisten Geschäfte und Restaurants geschlossen. Man ist aber über die nahe gelegene Ubahn Station gut mobil und die Ubahn Liverpool Street mit vielen Restaurants im Umkreis nicht weit weg. Wir hatten ein schönes Zimmer im fünften Stock des Hotels, es war ruhig und das Zimmer war gut ausgestattet. Das Bett war sehr groß, einziges Manko war die Matratze, die nach meiner Einschätzung etwas zu hart war. Das Personal an der Rezeption war freundlich. Beim Auschecken wurden uns Getränke für die Minibar berechnet, nach kurzer Info das wir die Minibar nicht angerührt hatten, wurden die Kosten sofort erstattet.","Hamburg, Germany",7/15/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Great smaller hotel in financial district,"Good customer service, comfortable room and amenities. Big tub and shower. Love tea/coffee service in room and extra waters.

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Excelente hotel bien situado,"He pasado dos noches a primeros de Noviembre para visita turistica en Londres de fin de semana, el hotal esta muy bien situado, estando a 4 paradas de metro del centro monumental de Londres, zona tranquila con bonitos edificios. El hotal esta nuevo, decorado confortablemente y de calidad, estuve alojado en habitacion para una persona, esta era un poco pequeña pero confortable, la unica pega era el frio que entraba por la ventana, El servicio muy atento y siempre a tu disposición. Desayono basico pero correcto y tranquilo. | Totalmente recomendable, volveria sin dudarlo.","Bilbao, Spain",11/11/2013
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Great hotel,"My fiance and I stayed here on vacation, and loved the place! It is in a really cute part of Kensington. Far enough away from the bustle, but not so far that you can't walk to most attractions. I do wish that it had been a little bit closer to Kensington Station or Kensington Park, but the price of hotels seemed to go up exponentially the closer you got, so this was a good balance for us. | There were cute pubs right around the corner, and the neighborhood was adorable as well. | The rooms were very clean, albeit small. The front desk was great and the lobby is gorgeous! Much nicer than I was expecting! Don't miss the restaurant at the hotel, it was the best meal I ate in London!","Denver, Colorado",6/13/2016
The Savoy,5,One of the best hotels in London.,"For a 5* hotel The Savoy is superb. Service is excellent, and reception and concierge could not have been faulted. Bedroom was full of comfort and style. | The piano bar was extremely busy which you would expect for a Friday night, and we did not have to wait long for seats. | We ate in The Savoy Grill which was fine. Breakfast in the morning was a delight. Yes the hotel is expensive, but what a treat, having stayed here before. | There was only one down side. The stay was part of my 65th birthday celebrations. This was mentioned in an email to The Savoy, and again when we checked in at reception. Despite spending a total of nearly £800 for the 1 night stay, The Savoy did not recognise my special birthday, or put something complimentary in our room as a token of my milestone. A bottle say of sparkling wine would have been sufficient. I also mentioned this in my feedback questionnaire, asking for a response which I did not receive. | We will stay at The Savoy again, but do not expect any special favours.",Woodbridge,11/15/2016
"Bulgari Hotel, London",5,high tea,"I came with a group of 5 adults and one toddler, we booked last minute and ended up arriving 45 minutes early. The staff were all very good about this and said that they would be able to fit us in, they showed us to a sofa area by the fire, which was perfect for my young daughter to have a little play on the massive sofa. | all the food came out very well presented and all tasted lovely, when we had finished what we were given each time they asked if we wanted anymore of what we had just had or move on to the next course, we had a few extra each time but just picking what we wanted. | In total we were sat having tea for nearly 3 hours, even after this time the staff were in no rush to get rid of us asking if there was anything else we wanted. | The only thing i would say that is a bit negative would be there was no changing unit or place for me to change my daughters nappy, having to do her on the floor of the toilets.","Plymouth, United Kingdom",12/27/2013
Rhodes Hotel,4,Bene ma quante scale!!!,"L'hotel è in una zona signorile di Londra, subito sopra Hyde Park. Ci sono due metro a pochi passi (Lancaster Gate, linea Rossa e Paddington linee Bakerloo, Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City) e una stazione delle bici a noleggio. L'hotel è in una vecchia struttura parzialmente ristrutturata con staff gentile e camera (almeno la nostra) ristrutturata. Colazione media. Unica pecca (se avete la camera all'ultimo piano) sono le infinite scale per raggiungere la stanza da letto.","Poggio a Caiano, Italy",2/20/2018
Corinthia Hotel London,1,1 star service,"Wow what a disappointment! Booked this hotel through Amex FHR and will never return. First, upon check in it took almost thirty minutes for them to figure out our reservation and find our room. Once we get to the room we decided to go down to the ""famous"" afternoon tea. There were a few tables open when we got there. We waited by the host stand for about ten minutes before a very rude waitress came over and said ""what do you need?"" I told her we would like to do afternoon tea and she very rudely said "" no we are fully booked."" That's when my husband got very upset and told her we were guests and she should not be having such an attitude with us. Then she huffed and puffed and magically ""maybe one table is open, I'll check with my manager."" Another ten minutes and we are finally seated. The service there was virtually nonexistent and after 2.5 hours of being ignored we flagged down a random server to get our check. Then later that night we decided to go to the bar for some late night drinks and dessert. After being ignored again for ten minutes we finally got our drinks and kept asking for a dessert menu which never came. Again no service and had to flag down the server for a check. At this point we are very annoyed - what is the point of paying a premium for a 5 star hotel when they have such awful service? We called front desk and asked to speak to the general manager, Matthew Dixon, and were promised he would call back. Of course he doesn't call but has the ""assisting front desk manager"" call who doesn't know anything about anything. I see Mr. Dixon responds to all the reviews here so he must have a lot of free time to write to his guests on the internet but no time to call guests back while they are at the hotel. The complete lack of service here is appalling and we would never come back. Please save your $$ and go to the St. Regis","Newport Beach, California",4/13/2014
Rhodes Hotel,5,"Great place to stay, feel like home","Its was easy to access form the airport and easy to walk to the city center, perfect for me you wanted to see London.

Would most definitely stay again!,"Southampton, United Kingdom",5/21/2016
The Rembrandt,5,Great hotel,Room was very clean and quiet. Staff couldn't have been nicer and were very helpful. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were fluffy and soft which was nice to come back to after my long days in London. It's in a great location - about a 5 min walk from the tube station plus bus stations right outside the hotel. The V&amp;A Museum and Natural History Museum are right across the street. Many eateries and shopping nearby. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to London.,"Vista, California",3/26/2017
Ridgemount Hotel,4,Great location,"This hotel is in an excellent location and close to all major London attractions. Extremely good for families. We stayed there with 3 children and had 2 rooms between us. The rooms, although a little dated, were very clean and tidy. Only downside, our room did not have an en-suite which meant a treck down the hall way first thing in the morning, with the dining room opposite and next door! The staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was adequate and service was good. Would recommend to other families looking for good value/on a budget.",Aberystwyth,11/1/2007
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Stunning,"Such a lovely hotel, smells amazing with their own subtle Mondrian fragrance, and such welcoming helpful staff. | Room was so tastefully decorated with a perfect outlook of the Thames. We had brunch on arrival and ate it on the terrace overlooking the water.The food was really tasty and although we hadn't booked for breakfast, decided to have it the next morning as a the setting and service and food was first class. Funky cocktail bar, with waiters mixing cocktails to your own specification and tastes. | Highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back.","Rugby, United Kingdom",9/11/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Never Disappoints!,"We always stay at this hotel when we visit our daughters in London.

The Savoy,2,Faded glory,"Why on earth would anyone pay the money to stay here when there are so many other lovely hotels in London. The entire hotel is desperate for a massive upgrade. Dr Who wouldn't stay here in any time zone. The entrance and vestibule looked like a refugee camp and and one of the restaurants was stinking of fish, should it not smell of the sea? Anyway we walked in and straight out of the cocktail bar. What a sleazy experience.","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",11/26/2013
Corinthia Hotel London,5,You will not be disappointed,"This was our second visit in the last couple of years. | Ask yourself: | 1. Do you want to stay and sleep in the best hotel in London? (IMHO of course) | 2. Do you want to stay in a hotel that is 100m, or so, from the London high life but has one of the most tranquil and quiet road side entrances you could ever wish for? | 3. Do you wish to enter your room, wander around your room, shower in your room, sleep in your room and wake up in your room with a 'wow'? | If so, then stay at the Corinthia. It is as easy as that.","Norwich, England",2/10/2015
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,The Mandarin Oriental London,"Although under refurbishment, we had the most amazing stay. The staff are very welcoming and make you feel very special.

Corinthia Hotel London,5,Amazing one night stay!,"After a very unpleasant stay at the Lanesborough, we decided to try this hotel for 1 night.

Corinthia Hotel London,5,A city resort,"A Hotel? No more. Luxurious? No more. A SPA? No more. This is truly a resort town without any compromise. I stayed in more than 1,000 luxury hotels in the world but never found a service so attentive. Staff were polite and discreet. A perfect evening turn down. Chocolates, water, fruit and orchids are always present in the room. Each request is answered quickly. Definitely the best hotel in all 2011 where I was.",milano,12/21/2011

The Dorchester,4,Understated class,Had a weekend away from the kids and enjoyed the understate class of one of the best hotels in London. We ate and drank at the hotel too as there did not seem to be any need to leave the sanctuary and luxury. Get a room up as high as possible for the view.,"London, United Kingdom",11/15/2015
The Rembrandt,4,Localização ideal,"Hotel Rembrandt tem boa relação com qualidade e preço e, especialmente a localização. Para quem vai a Londres o Harrold's é fundamental e no entorno o melhor comercio. Tb bons restaurantes , em frente ao Hotel o Victoria e Albert Museum, um pouco depois o de História Natural, talvez mais importante do mundo.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,New Years Eve,"We stayed for two nights over New Year in a room with a view of the fireworks. We found the hotel and staff to be excellent. Whilst obviously a luxury hotel, the atmosphere and staff are very relaxed although still being professional and attentive. The only constructive criticism would be the limited menu in the Sea Containers restaurant, especially for vegetarians. If you plan a similar trip next year, be aware that you have to ensure you tell the hotel you would like a room with a view of the fireworks (this year it was called the Ultimate View package). River view rooms and the restaurant, bar and Rumpus room (where the New Year's Eve party takes place) do not allow views of the fireworks because the hotel is on the same side of the river where the fireworks are let off.","Surrey, United Kingdom",1/4/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Lovely Corinthia,"Posso afirmar categoricamente que para mim poucos hotéis irão superar a esse. Certamente há mais luxuosos, e este o é bastante,mas luxo não preenche a todos os requisitos que vejo importantes em uma estadia. | A recepção foi acolhedora e confortável, com o quarto já pronto e sem filas no check in. | O hotel possui um time de recepcionistas simpáticos e atenciosos, sendo que o que nos atendeu saiu conosco a nos mostrar os restaurantes e salões, indo até o quarto para terminar a apresentação. Raro. | O quarto muito espaçoso tinha tudo necessário ao conforto, inclusive com televisão na banheira. | Salão de chá, bar do hotel, dois restaurantes, academia e spa:tudo de excelente padrão. | A localização é especial, próximo a Trafalgar Square, Parlamento, Big Ben. E a uma caminhada confortável para Columbus Circus, Soho, Oxford Street e China Town. | Muitos pubs por perto e ótimas opções de restaurantes.",NA,6/12/2017
Ridgemount Hotel,4,"Zentral, gut und guenstig","Das Hotel ist fuer einen London-Besuch ideal gelegen: Zentral um die Stadt zu Fuss zu erkunden (oder zumindest Teile davon) oder auch mit der Underground, fuer die es gleich mehrere Haltestellen verschiedener Linien in der Naehe hat. Das Einzelzimmer war sehr klein und einfach, aber vollstaendig eingerichtet. No frills, aber das was man fuer ein paar Tage zum Uebernachten braucht. Alles super sauber, was ja in Grossbritannien leider nicht immer selbstverstaendlich ist. Gutes typisch englisches gekochtes Fruehstueck. Kaffe und Teee umsonst in der Lounge den ganzen Tag. Sehr freundliche und hilfsbereite Besitzer.",Heidelberg,11/21/2010
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Splendid hotel,"I stayed here recently for 2 nights. The hotel and the customer service was really excellent. Check in was efficiently done by Paolo, who then took me to my room. There was only a Nespresso machine and he asked if I would like to have a kettle as well to make tea, which I did. I asked also for an iron and board. All was brought to the room quickly. The room itself was nicely decorated. The bathroom was very big and had a rain shower and a separate bath tub. As said the service was good, breakfast was also really nice and the bar in the hotel had a wide range of drinks. | I went twice to the gym which is very modern and big. The location of the hotel (Whitehall, close to the Thames and Embankment station ) is fantastic. The only remark I have is that the bed could be a bit longer as for me as a north European is was just a bit too short. | Summarized, a great stay, very helpful staff , so if you have the opportunity to stay here, do it!","Amsterdam, The Netherlands",2/22/2018
The Savoy,4,rooms not ready on time,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel almost a fortnight ago, what a splendid place it is, the surroundings are just wonderful, everywhere you look is opulent and grand. We were only there for one night to attend a ball that was being held there, so decided to treat ourselves to a stay there too. We have attended the event on other occasions but stayed elsewhere before and shall do so again. | You can only imagine how disappointed we were when we arrived at around 2.00pm to be led into a beautiful room but to be told we had stated our eta had been 2.30pm so the room was not ready, however, we thought ok a nice spot of lunch...No...all full up but as the gentleman advised if we just walked outside there were lots of places to eat, but it was cold and we both wanted to go to our room but would happily had we known this would give us a problem reserved somewhere to lunch as our plan was to have room service at lunch time in the room we had booked some considerable time before. They took a telephone number and said they would call us when the room was ready. Strange but we thought if that's the way we do it, so off we went in search of somewhere to eat but almost everywhere was full so we settled on a small café we came across, not what we had hoped for but nevertheless it was warm and the food was simple fayre. After lunch and NO!!! phone call we walked back to the Savoy, this is now 3.00pm later than our eta as they put it??? Still no room, and we asked at reception and they offered us a drink in the American Bar then. I didn't really want a fancy coffee I wanted to go to our room which eventually became ready about 3.45pm and we had to get ready and go down to ball around half six, felt rushed and although the room was pleasant, it was smallish. We found out later that a lot of people who stayed there had the self same problem rooms either hadn't been done from the night before or were not ready. Come on!!! This is the SAVOY not the B&amp;B round the corner, not good enough Savoy, not good enough at least not at the prices you charge which although considerable you wouldn't mind if you got a room in which to spend. | The ball was OK not as good as previous years and I don't know who did the catering but vegetables can be al dente but raw is a problem, no one could get a fork in them, the amount of plates that went back untouched was dreadful. | However, the breakfast was really good, that is about all there is to say so if you fancy breakfast this is a nice place to eat.","willenhall, west mids",12/8/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,5,A hotel to end all hotels,"What a place. Understated, quality, service, food - everything was just right. If I was to choose a hotel for a specail occasion this is it. The food at breakfast was all fresh, and marked with its origin , there was nothing missing. Staff are friendly and on a wet October day just cashually handing me an umrella to keep my wife dry.","Manchester, United Kingdom",12/7/2013
The Rembrandt,2,Not what it used to be,"My family and I stayed at the Rembrandt hotel many times in the late 1980's and early 90's and were delighted with the hotel at the time. We expected to experience the same good service and lovely rooms that we had once experienced when we visited in December 2005. | It was however one problem after another from the moment we arrived. We experienced several problems checking in, mostly due to a lack of knowledge of the hotel rooms by the desk staff as well an inability to understand and communicate efficiently in English. We were shown into a room that was already occupied, had to switch rooms due to construction that the front desk was unaware of and then were given a master key to the hotel (we found out when we accidentally opened the wrong room). We also did not receive phone messages for several days and were given incorrect information by the concierge. We were also treated rudely by a maid who was annoyed that she could not make up our room at 9:00am. We received a response to our complaints after our visit by the head of Sarova hotels which contained many careless spelling mistakes and only offered us a VERY slight upgrade for a future stay. Very disappointing and indicative of the sloppy manner in which this hotel is managed! The only plus is the great location.","Toronto, Ontario",4/11/2006
Rhodes Hotel,4,Perfect for the budget traveler,"My husband and I stayed at the Rhodes Hotel last week for four nights. We decided to save a bit of money this trip and chose the Rhodes Hotel for it's price and the good reviews on this website. We asked for a twin room on a lower floor and that is exactly what we got. The room was behind reception and it was a little noisy at times but not a major issue. To be fair, I don't think they use this room very often as everything in the room was quite dusty at first. Not dirty, just dusty. However, after that first day, the room was spotless. We also requested an early check in which we got. That was extremely helpful. | The hotel is very typical for this price range. Tiny room, miniscule bathroom, etc. But it also had some very good points such as comfy beds, a fantastic location close to two Tube stations that had 5 different lines running through them, a refrigerator in the room which we loved and a great powerful shower with lots of attachments. Never a lack of hot water, either. We really only met Mrs. Crias and she was lovely and very helpful. There is one computer downstairs that I used to check in for our flight home and you print from it for free and it goes to the reception printer. Very handy. My only real gripe is that you are only given one set of keys for the room. One evening I had them and my husband came back to the room early and he had to ask someone to let him. Not an issue but he hated having to bother them. We did not take part in breakfast while we were there as we usually slept in, but there is an awesome little cafe called ""Raffles"" around the corner on Praed Street which does a cheap and plentiful breakfast. we go there every time we are in London, the food is that good. If you happen to miss breakfast at the hotel, go there. | If we decided to go back to London on a reduced budget, we would not hesitate to stay here again. One more thing...the area of Sussex Gardens seems to get a bad rap for no reason. The street was clean, quiet and felt very safe.","Rockaway, New Jersey",3/30/2009
The Savoy,5,pure Class and luxury,I went for a business meeting . I was welcomed with very friendly smiles and first class service . | My evening in the piano lounge was warm and comforting and the aura was superb . I show cased my book there with amazing people ..

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Luxury in London,"I treated my husband to a night at the Mandarin Oriental hotel for our 30th wedding anniversary recently. We were married very young, so received many congratulations and exhortations on how COULD we be married for so long! Very flattering, and undoubtably the staff did their best to ensure we had a great night. | The greeting from the doorman, to the receptionist was charming, and they continued to call us by name on each chance meeting. The room (a basic double) was small but charming. Perfectly ok for one night. The hotel style is 'English country house'. We had a package that included a massage each in the spa, which was lovely but pricey. The staff gave us each a little bag of goodies on hearing about our wedding anniversary. We had a wonderful dinner at Heston' 'Dinner' where the food was superb. The total cost for room, massage and dinner was approx £1600 pounds, and we DONT drink alcohol! Pew were gifted a bottle of champagne, but swapped it for a tonic water each, and were more than happy with this. When we were at dinner the staff decorated our bed with rose petals, a delightful touch. If you want to celebrate in London I WOULD recommend this hotel. A big thank you to the wonderful staff. See you in another 30 years!","London, United Kingdom",6/17/2014
Corinthia Hotel London,4,A mixture of feelings,This was a Christmas gift from a friend for work we had done together. | I've stayed in some wonderful hotels around Europe and a few in London and this was my first time at the renowned Cortinthia London. | Receptionist team where outstanding in explaining everything - a quick tour of the hotel and shown to our delightful room. | We then had the afternoon shopping and back to the hotel to prepare for dinner. | The room was incredible and watching tv in the bath whilst having champagne is a must! | Dinner was in the Massimo restaurant - overall this was outstanding. | So the niggles (and they are only niggles) | I'd sent a shirt to be pressed and had to chase for it's return. | On checkin reception asked when could housekeeping come to turn down the beds - they arrived an hour early when they caught us dressing. | I'd taken the sommeliers advice over the wine I'd had with the meal and it missed my taste requirements by a mile so a £120 bottle didn't get touched bar half a glass. | So many things are chargeable extras and the charges are incredibly high. Example 2 coffees and two mince pies £22 | My nearest comparison would be the Conrad which I've used a number of times. The Corinthia is around double the cost and for me just didn't hit the target quite to the standard I was hoping for. | Would I return again - of course it's great and far better than most. Is it worth double the Conrad - sadly not on this visit.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",11/20/2016
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,View of the park,"I hadn't stayed at the hotel since its first opening as the Mandarin Oriental quite some time ago and probably wouldn't have returned if I hadn't been going to eat at Dinner by Heston Blumental. We were very pleasantly surprised by our fairly spacious room with a lovely view over the park at the back of the hotel, which was comfortable and most importantly very quiet. The room had French windows which actually open and would be a great choice at any time of year but was really special with the Autumn colours of the trees. | The facilities are as expected in a hotel of the class and size, only niggle (as usual) is the charge for Internet access.",Switzerland,11/24/2012
The Savoy,5,Tea at the Savoy,"Was there 16 years ago and loved the splendor but the newly refurbed Savoy has lost none of the charm and exclusivity while shining in its newly outfitted glory!!

Can't wait to go back.","London, United Kingdom",5/14/2013
The Savoy,5,"So good, had to stay again.","Enjoyed our stay in June at The Savoy so much we had to stay again in September. Lovely, clean rooms not noisy with a comfortable bed. Even though we had the same room category (Deluxe King) the room was a bit different this time. Thought I wouldn't like it as much because it was a bit smaller and bathroom was smaller but turned out to be great. Two nice windows gave it plenty of light in the day yet curtains were sufficient to darken the room at night. If we bent our head toward the side of one of the windows we could see the river. Service is great and they give you your complete privacy.",New York,11/13/2011
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,A grandiose experience.,"Having been in London when England were playing Wales and One Direction as well, London was heaving. I had passed this place before and kept it in mind when I was meeting a friend for drinks at nearby Founder's pub. We agreed to find something to eat but open table said no immediate reservations. So discounted it. However passing by it looked quieter then expected and we asked on the off chance Syed said of course come in. We were taken towards the back of the restaurant by the window with a beautiful view of the Thames and St. Paul's. Ground level view of course. We had Andrea from Sicily assigned to us. We chose a Pinot Grigio due to my friends intolerance to red. It was fairly quiet when we sat down and felt in no way pressured to rush ordering. Having not dressed for a night out some restaurants casually deny you. But I felt nothing but appreciating we were been looked after. We ordered a bottle of sparkling and still water as well. Starters were mainly sea orientated. I plumed for tuna crudo and my friend chose the octopus salad. Presentation was simple but stunning. She professed the octopus salad to be the best octopus she's ever had, just the right amount. Presented with forbidden black rice, sobrassada sausage and cucumber.My tuna was weaved with avocado, artichoke and olives. Our glasses were never allowed to run out with Andrea coming across and refilling our glasses. The place was getting busier with bigger parties coming in. A trip to the restrooms I saw the iconic work of Tom Dixon.a beautiful busy open kitchen keys you see how hard they work. We ordered the lamb and the duck both recommended medium rare. Accompanied by side of new potatoes and mushrooms. I have to say when it arrived, the flavours if the meat were sublime. Though the mushrooms were a revelation. I have never tasted mushrooms like this before. The amount just right again and on the top end side at £20 and £24 for a main, we felt the boat was pushed out. Good company, nice wine, great view and a good atmosphere whilst now full more or less, noise was not intrusive to our conversation and finishing off with a espresso. Our meal was drawing to a close, bill duly presented and paid. It was for me been the visitor to London, a reminder if good service and what it's all about. I had thought to myself it reminded me of the Sanderson and St Martins in the lane...I looked later it was part of the group. So if you are about on the Southbank, here is something as a group or couple who would enjoy a good night out and feel well looked after. I look forward to going again.","Northampton, United Kingdom",9/27/2015

Rhodes Hotel,5,My favourite London Secret,"As a World Traveller with my own Travel Blog and frequent trips to London, once discovering the Rhodes Hotel, I would not think of staying anywhere else! It is truly my top pick for a boutique, clean, friendly and conveniently located hotel. The staff are always professional and friendly. They remember me each time I return which says alot. They also take to heart any special requests I make regarding room location and much more. | The rooms are clean with new furnishings, the wi-fi works like a dream, and their breakfast room cozy and comfortable offering anything from Continental to full English breakfasts. In addition, their location is perfect, only a few minutes walk from Paddington Station where I always arrive on the Heathrow Express following my international flight. It is also a few blocks from Hyde Park where I enjoy peaceful strolls. For shopping both Oxford High St as well as Kensington High Streets are not far away. My favourite pub, The Victoria, is just around the corner, and is a true local's pub, serving up delicious food and beverages. | I highly recommend the Rhodes Hotel to all those wanting top notch budget accommodation in the heart of London.","Telluride, CO",12/15/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Great Hotel!,"I stayed at the Mondrian with my sisters and a friend for a long weekend and we were all really impressed with the hotel! It had a really cool vibe and really friendly and helpful staff. The buffet breakfast was really good and we had lunch outside next to the river which was a great location plus the food was excellent. It was so nice to sit outside and have lunch in such a chilled atmosphere which was a contrast to the usual hustle and bustle of London. | The room was really big, as was the bathroom. Plenty of room for four of us! We didn't have a view but we weren't too bothered as we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. | Loved the candle and room spray touch, I really wish I'd bought the candle now! | Black Friars Station was only a short walk away and Borough Market was also walking distance so a great location for getting around different locations in London. | I would definitely stay at this hotel again!",NA,5/8/2016
The Rembrandt,5,Charming hotel,"This is the third time I have stayed at the rembrandt. The hotel has gone thru some upgrades as in adding Wi-Fi to all the rooms. We had a street room with a lovely view and did not hear any traffic. We love the breakfast, the front desk, location and overall charm of this wonderfully located hotel. Strongly recommend a stay here.",NA,10/16/2016
The Savoy,5,They've got it just right,"Stayed at the Savoy for two nights a little while back and was most impressed. I've been fortunate to stay in several top-notch London hotels as well as one or two less 'well known', for my money The Savoy is the best hotel experience in London. | I arrived by black cab to be greeted by the doorman, he asked if I was checking in and promptly whisked my bags away. Into the beautiful lobby area which is at first quite small and into the 'check in room', they don't have desks instead opting for a seated check-in. I was shown to my deluxe room which was beautifully appointed. As I am sure everyone knows, this hotel has had a major refurbishment but they've retained the charm of the hotel whilst bringing it into this millennium! My room was spacious as was the bathroom which I swear was as big as the bedroom itself, albeit accessed by a very narrow door - quite a bizarre set-up but rather charming. | Location of the hotel is spot-on, right in the heart of theatre land, and the staff like most Fairmont trained staff are there to serve and get it just right, none of the pomp and ceremony you get from some other 'Ritzy' establishments, just a common sense approach to making your stay a welcome one. | Breakfast in the River Restaurant is excellent, albeit I found the service a little 'too much', perhaps one becomes accustomed to a lack of service sometimes. Had a couple of drinks both in the lobby and in the incredibly chintzy Beaufort Bar, the cocktails are excellent and priced at what you'd expect for this calibre of hotel, and the beds are amazingly comfortable. | There was little I could fault The Savoy on to be honest, everything during my stay was fantastic, I'm looking forward to returning.","Dundee, United Kingdom",11/25/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,#JustAwesome,"Firstly, I'm a fan of Morgans group of hotels and was really excited that I was about to spend a few days checking out their latest hotel in London. Booked online and price was reasonable based on two sharing a room and stayed for three nights in total. The conceirge team were the best I have ever encountered at a hotel and helped with arranging key parts of my trip with awesome recommendations and reserversations for a number of great restaurants and venues around London. Very helpful and super quick. Took the stress out of London for sure! | Room was great and loved the goodies - the fortune cookie was fab :-) | Bathroom was clean, lots of space and great products for guests. | Top floor bar with a lovely view of London was great fun. A bit over priced for the drinks (saw this on another review and agree) and glasses are way too small! If bar staff were a bit more attentive rather than chatting up the girls that would be apprecaited as we waited over 15 mins to get served at the bar... not fun! | Overally, hotel was great and would recommend to all my friends and family.","London, United Kingdom",5/4/2015
The Rembrandt,4,Bra',Ett hotell i London som både är prisvärt och bra! Trevlig personal! Bra läge i en bra del av London! Nära till tunnelbana och Victoria station! Bra och god frukost! | Ingen toalettborste på toaletten! Lite jobbigt om man är tre i ett rum!! |,"Landskrona, Sweden",1/7/2017
The Savoy,5,Muy buen hotel,"The Savoy: es el mejor hotel que haya ido en my vida. | Te tratan muy bien, los cuartos están excelentes. El edificio está decorado muy bonito. Tienes internet si lo pagas.Tiene una tienda de chocolates, macarones, cupcackes, etc. También tiene un restaurante que se llama Savoy Grill, muy bueno solo que es caro, y además es del chef Ramsay. El hotel esta muy bueno.","Mexico City, Mexico",8/19/2014
The Savoy,5,Definitely worth the treat.,"Yes it isn't cheap but a stay at The Savoy is really worth it for a special treat. We booked dinner, bed and breakfast and were then able to pay a little more to upgrade to the next room level. | Everything was perfect, room, service, food, we would come again.","Battle, United Kingdom",5/27/2015
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",5,A gem in London town,"I stayed at The Wellesley in July 2014 for two nights and, based on that experience, was wowed. On check-in, my wife and I were asked if we would like to upgrade to a suite for a nominal fee. We accepted, and in doing so, transformed our experience. | The staff: we arrived fairly early from Dublin (where we had stayed the previous several days) and were rushing to Nottinham for a family event. The staff was very accommodating, allowing us early check-in to our room and giving us the option of morning tea (though we were not told that we would be charged for the tea). Our butler was amazing; on our return from Nottingham late that night, our luggage was unpacked and neatly placed on the shelves (I was just glad that my dirty laundry was in a separate, clearly identified area). She was also instrumental in getting our formal clothes ready in record time - this more than helped us to overlook the tea incident. As an icing to an incredible staff experience, we were also given a courtesy ride to Novikov (to have dinner with friends) in The Wellesley's Rolls-Royce house car - I beamed. | The room: we were given the Ella Fitzgerald suite (so I am unable to comment on the standard room). The room was amazing, and I was almost overwhelmed by the attention to detail and luxury that it exuded. The bathroom presentation was exquisite (Hermes toiletries and heated flooring helps in this regard) and the bed was fairly comfortable. | I wish we had more time to spend at the Wellesley, but home beckoned and we had to bid adieu. It will remain one of my top choices for hotels in London for my next visit.","Jersey City, New Jersey",8/26/2014
The Savoy,5,Amazing experience,"From the moment we pulled up to the door to the minute we regrettably left the Savoy we had a perfect experience. The staff is gracious, professional and friendly. Our room was absolutely lovely. Very well maintained and very spacious with a lovely sitting room. Air-conditioning worked perfectly (very important to my husband). Bathroom was well appointed with very nice amenities. Service was excellent at every level. The common areas are beautiful and the history of the Savoy is something not to be missed. We can't wait to return.","New York City, New York",7/31/2014
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Brilliant Hotel!,"A brilliant hotel, with fantastic staff and exceptional service. My husband and I would most definitely come again! Very clean and in an ideal location, only a few minutes walk from Earls Court station. The food in the restaurant was to a very high standard, would reccomend even going there for dinner. The hotel did not have the usual busy, chaotic atmosphere that we have experienced in hotels before. We hope to be back soon",NA,5/26/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Perfection,"We stayed at Corinthia for a mini break and the hotel is perfection itself. Everything from the check in to check out is performed with perfection. The staff are extremely helpful and can't do enough for you. The room was everything you'd expect and more at this price range, good size, great shower with both rainbow and hand held options, good tv options and even a tv in the bathroom. We had cocktails in the evening before going out to dinner and again the suggestions were spot on. To top it off we had breakfast in the bedroom which was, for want of a better word, perfect. We popped into the spa area for a bit too which really is an oasis of tranquility in central London. The hotel is well located, 2 mins walk from tube and Thames clipper stops and 4 mins from a train station. We shopped, ate out in town and still came away completely relaxed and that doesn't often happen on a City break.",Kent,5/3/2017
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",3,Small Rooms,Nice property and super helpful staff. The location is also good - you can take the tube from Heathrow. The stop is just a couple blocks from the Earl's Court station. The rooms are very small however.,NA,2/24/2017
The Rembrandt,3,Apenas Razoável,"Como tudo em Londres, é caro para o que oferece. Talvez por causa da conversão da moeda, o fato é que o hotel é bem localizado e os funcionários são atenciosos. Contudo, o tamanho dos quartos e dos banheiros não são compatíveis com o preço. O café da manhã também poderia ser melhor para um hotel 4 estrelas.",NA,7/27/2013
The Savoy,5,Absolutely Fan-tas-tic!,"Wonderful environment/decor/facilities...top location with great views from some suites and rooms. Just the best! Very discrete but attentive service provides just the right balance. Exceptional cleanliness, great staff...I could go on but you get the picture...The Savoy is in a class of its own.","Cardiff, United Kingdom",6/19/2013

Rhodes Hotel,5,Value for money!,"It is an old fashioned but very charming hotel in one of the best areas in central London. | My single room was really small but very confortable;as well as the bathroom.When I made the reservation I asked for a room in the main building;they confirmed it immediately.The only problem was that my room was on 4th floor,and there is no elevator.I can't complain,as it was my choice.When I checked in(earlier than usual) Mr.Stefano in the reception got my luggage up to the 4th floor;and when I left a Lady (I am sorry,I don't know her name) brought down my heavy suitcase. Breakfast was delicious and the ladies in breakfast room,which is small but I never waited to sit,are very kind.Everybody working in Rhodes Hotel is very helpful and polite. Lancaster Gate tube station is less than 300 meters away,and Lancaster Gate bus stop is 250 meters (you can get the buses to Piccadilly Circus,to Victoria,Buckingham Palace,Westminster etc).Paddington station also,is very close to the hotel.Somemore things,I have never seen in other hotels:three days before I got there,they sent an email;I didn't have to reconfirm my reservation.Two days after I returned they sent a -thank you email-.The owner,the people working there,have made a book providing any information about London;you can find it in every room. I stayed in this hotel for four nights;I wish I could stay more! I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT!",Athens,12/7/2016

Corinthia Hotel London,5,In one word,"WOW! | Normally I am a man of many words but this one word will suffice. The rooms,service,brunch and Massimo's all without fault. Room was ready early. Bed was supper comfortable and compared to many hotels in London the room was HUGE! I was in the UK for a Tank Regiment Parade and I forgot that right out the door in Whitehall was the statue in honour of those who have served their country in peace and war from The RTR! | I normally stay at either Duke's or The Connaught but will try to make this hotel my landing pad of choice | Do yourself a favour.",Toronto,8/21/2014
The Dorchester,5,Very posh afternoon tea,"I went to the Dorchester with my Auntie and Uncle to have afternoon tea. Lovely cakes, tea, sandwiches and more. Friendly service and lovely decorations. Would go here again and loved receiving a birthday cake as they asked if there was an occasion. I was able to bring home a bag of the leftover cakes to enjoy later!","Essex, United Kingdom",2/22/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,"Fantastic hotel, lovely spa","This hotel has got it just right. From the rooms - comfortable with easy to use lighting etc - to the staff - friendly, helpful and welcoming. Afternoon tea is a must and the breakfast is definitely worth having. The spa and pool are absolutely gorgeous, do not miss out on trying them. This is my favourite London hotel, absolutely fabulous!",UK,7/16/2013
Rhodes Hotel,4,Buen hotel para pasar unos días en Londres,"El hotel está situado en un barrio tranquilo. Se encuentra a dos minutos andando de Hyde Park y de la estación de metro Lancaster Gate. Cuanta también con parada de bus cercana (delante del metro), por lo que está muy bien comunicado. La habitación era grande y estaba limpia. El desayuno no tenia mucha variedad pero era correcto.","Barcelona, España",11/17/2015
The Dorchester,5,Quality and good service,"We stayed 4 days in a great room. Excellent sevice and very friendly people, Very expensive but worth the money. We left for our trip back to Norway and checked in at Heathrow. In security I discovered that my PC was left behind at the hotel! I called the concierge and - to my great relief - they found the PC and came driving to Heathrow and gave back my PC to me! Quick and friendly! And no talk of extra payment! My PC is an important tool for work, so that really made the day! Thank you very much!",Norway,7/29/2018
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Lovely hotel with gorgeous rooms,"The Mondrian feels a bit like the W, it's very well-appointed, with neat little touches everywhere. Nice minibar, bluetooth connectivity for your phone to the tv, and advanced lighting controls throughout the room. The room was actually far more spacious than it appeared online, and the design was thoughtful, including lots of storage space throughout. The bathroom was modern and sleek, bedding was super soft, and the shower was fantastic, although the strange lack of a door and non-sloping floor meant the floor was always flooded. | The hotel itself is beautiful, from the check-in counter to the restaurants and bars. Staff was friendly. It's a 6 min walk to the tube or a few minutes walk to the waterfront where there are tons of restaurants. Overall I truly felt like I was staying in a 5 star hotel. Would not hesitate to stay again, though I would recommend holding out for a special rate because the regular prices are far too high.","Foster City, California",9/7/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Really loved this hotel. Fabulous room and lovely staff.,"I booked this after researching on Trip Advisor. Right from our arrival everything was great (including being able to check-in early). Reception staff really friendly and welcoming. | Our room was gorgeous. Modern, new and comfortable. Great range of free snacks and drinks. The bathroom was to die for, with a huge bath and a separate shower big enough to share! A truly lovely hotel room. | The hotel is quiet and we slept so well. Convenient location for a trip to London. Just a few minutes walk to the tube station (we used Bank station). Easy to get to and from the West-End or to walk to St Paul's, South Bank etc. The hotel's left luggage facility was most useful on our departure day. | We will definitely stay here when we next visit London (asuming the price is still right).","Gloucestershire, England.",6/28/2011
The Rembrandt,4,Lovely!,"Lovely hotel...we stayed in an executive double room such a lovely room king size bed and very spacious with a seating area. The view wasn't great so we kept the curtains closed. But it was lovely to chill on the sofa and drink a glass of wine with some music. The room had a dock to listen to your own music or the radio. The bathroom was lovely too and spacious, but the room we had the lights were not working above the bath area so where I wanted a relaxing bath it was a tad too dark. The hotel people was kind enough to come have a look but due my stay being a Sunday they had no maintenance staff working so requested I moved room which I declined so they gave me a bottle of wine on the house which was very kind of them. We did order room service which wasn't too bad for dinner. As for breakfast it was nice but very cramp and a lot going on in the morning. Overall a lovely hotel and would stay again! Oh we did have fitness passes too but I didn't realise what time it closed and I think I went downstairs little too late for them to let me in, which I was gutted.","London, United Kingdom",8/13/2015
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Elegant hotel in quiet area,"We stayed for the week-end, and since this hotel is in the City it was very quiet. Keep in mind that most cafees and small shops in the area is closed in the week-end. But Liverpool station and Bank metro is a short walk away. | The room was clean and welcoming. Friendly staff in the reception. | We had dinner at the hotel restaurant upon our arrival Friday, but the service was some what lacking. Good food, which was served from the kitchen fast. | A great hotel to stay at!","Oslo, Norway",10/16/2012
Marble Arch Hotel,3,So so,"They try their best... | - negative points: | the rooms are small | the tv in the rooms is really small | No cabs outside of the hotel | There was no nightporter just when we needed a cab | - positive points | There is an nespresso machine in the room | They are really friendly | The water in the room | They try their best with the little touches in the room like the wallpaper and the art next to the elevator | Amazing location very quiet and peacefull but still central, very safe and welcoming place","London, United Kingdom",11/11/2017
The Dorchester,5,"Fantastic,Marvellous,Superb 5 stars in all its glory.","We had stayed at the Park Plaza Riverbank for 2 nights,prior to going to The Dorchester. | On our arrival outside the Dorchester you are met by a very welcoming doorman,who asked if we were checking in,as we already knew that check in was 3.00pm and we arrived at 10.00am,so we would have the concierge take our suitcase.The doorman said thats okay I'll take it and send it to our room when we check in.Easy. | Anyway off we went and came back about 4.00pm,when I booked I'd said that it was the wifes birthday.I was keeping my fingers crossed we would be blessed with a room upgrade? | At reception we were welcomed and informed that yes indeed we had a room upgrade.The receptionist took us up to the 6th floor,and led us to our room.Followed immediately by our suitcase etc. | To say the bedroom was nice would be an understatement,it was marvellous.It was we think a King deluxe,the bed was the size of a room.You didn't appreciate how big the bed was until you got onto it to sleep,.The room itself is what you'd expect from such an iconic hotel.Also forgot to say that there was a small Birthday cake in the room waiting for the wife- marvellous once again. | The bathroom was fantastic all marble and mirrors,with every luxury you would want,a very large towel rail,toileteries etc. | The room itself looked over Hyde Park,the tree's still had some glorious golden leaves left on,being a little further south from us. | The previous night (Saturday)we had come to the Dorchester to dine at Alain Ducasse,which we expected to be very nice and expensive.We weren't disapointed at all,very expensive and superb food,some of which was memorable.The service in this restaurant is something else,nothing was too much trouble,the staff were there at your beck and call.The somellier was very good,informative,knowledgable but not pushy,very pleasant and helpful. | We can't speak highly enough of this restaurant,we've tried lots of good restaurants over the years,but had never dined at a 3 Michelin starred place.You can understand why it has 3 of them,and we can say perhaps the best we've been to. | On the Sunday evening we dined at the grill,this was also exemplary in respect of service | perhaps not as good as AD,but again what you'd expect of a 5 star hotel.The food itself was very nice,perhaps a little expensive but again something we knew of before we booked.Plus another birthday cake for the wife,which we took away with us. | Breakfast again was great,the service was impeccable and food of usual 5 star standard. | We can't speak/rate the Dorchester highly enough,to say we enthuse about the place and our visit,would be the usual understatement. | If you are ever looking for a beautiful experience,memorable visit,special occasion then you've found the place.If you can't afford it,save for it. It'll repay you with respect and fond memories. | We were going to stay at the Savoy,but Gordon Ramsay's grill room wasn't to be opened until late November.He the did the Savoy a diservice by opening late,but in doing so gave us the opportunity to sample the delights of The Dorchester. | And to write a 5star review as a result | Thank you The Dorchester and all the staff that served us.",England,11/19/2010
Corinthia Hotel London,1,Way below expectations,"We usuallly stay in Jumeirah Carlton. good pool and fitness facilities plus location determind our choice. Room is way too small, hardly can locate ourselves there. Very dark and airless. You wouldnt expect it in the room for over £400. Some simple amenities like dental kits, decaf coffee, milk and drinking water was not in the room so had to call for them. Very grumpy doormen. Staff doesnt know wher is what in hotel and cannot direct you. | Good location, good spa. | As I spend most of my days in different hotels around the world and this one is the biggest disappointment I had. Definitely not value for money. Advise to use other hotels within same pricerange.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates",1/8/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"Everything about the hotel is fantastic: service, hotel restaurants and bars, rooms and location! I first went to the Corinthia a few years ago because I had read that they had a great afternoon tea. When I needed to book a London hotel recently, I remembered that tea. It was delicious, generous (unlimited ""refill"" of tea and sandwiches and probably pastries but, by then, we were too full) and service was completely unpretentious. I decided that, if their tea was that good, that might portend other good things about the hotel. I was right. The location was perfect - you can walk to the West End theaters and many restaurants and, if you need to venture farther out, the Embankment station is right across the street. We were upgraded to a suite and it was spacious, quiet and beautiful. After the theatre, we ate at the Massimo Italian restaurant in the hotel - the food was great. It was very late and there were few patrons but we were never rushed. We spent a different post-theatre evening in the hotel bar. It was also beautiful, there was live music and, when we ordered a second drink, the entire snack selection was replaced with a new set. We ate other meals in the hotel - in the lobby, in an outdoor fire lit space, room service - and each was great as was the service. I cannot recommend this hotel more highly.","Florence, Italy",6/15/2016
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",4,Great but small rooms,"The Hotel is very well decorated, modern and clean. The only downside was the size of the classic double room - it was tiny! There was a double bed pushed against the window and only enough for a bedside table the other side. We only stayed one night so it suited us but I would not want to spend anymore time there only because of the size of the room. Shame because apart from that it was great.",NA,7/3/2013
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Cool new happening hotel on the South bank,"I stayed here last weekend when the hotel had only been open three days. Already the bar was hip and happening. The staff were delightful and very excited about their new venture. Rightly so. Service was great and with a big smile from everyone, especially Adam who was looking after us. We had a standard room which was a very good size and with plenty of natural light. Very nice walk in rain shower and fab Malin and Goetz bath goodies. | The architecture with the copper hull of a boat which extends into the spa, ending as a tear drop in the rest area was very cool indeed. | The food was very good, the restaurant has a great view of the river, but the wine list still needs a bit of work. it was very expensive for rather unispiring wines. A couple of good red, whites and roses, priced between 20 and 30 pounds would be really welcome. Dandelyan bar was great and I look forward to visiting the rooftop bar when it opens. | The spa was calm and relaxing and I had an excellent pedicure from Fiona who was delightful and very experienced. The gym is well equipped, although it is a shame it does not have windows. A gym with a river view would have been really fabulous. That said it is possible to go for a really good run along the river. The hotel has an excellent location in the heart of the action on London's South bank. Very highly recommended","Dubai, United Arab Emirates",10/10/2014
The Savoy,5,Royal Tea is a must,"Ive been to the Savoy many times for tea, dinner and drinks. Ive been a big fan for a while and keep coming back but it is for a reason. Every time its a new experience. | Royal tea was fantastic. The decoration in the room was beautiful and the food was top notch. Couldnt have asked for more. I had to cancel my dinner reservation! So much food ! | The new jams were a nice touch and so was the new English wine. I couldnt remember the name but it was better than what I had before for sure. | Thanks to my waiter who was friendly and caring. He recognised me and my family again and even brought us some wedding cake slices before we left. | Already planning my next visit. | Thank you!","London, United Kingdom",5/6/2018
The Dorchester,5,A deserved Icon,"Stayed at The Dorchester in August and it continues to be classy, pretentious and up market. | Great postion and full of class and great service. | Not cheap but reasonable value for what you receive. You cant expect this caliber of hotel and service for less. | Great eating/drinking on property. | Wonderful gym and spa. | If you looking for upmarket with top service and you can afford the price then check into this London icon and enjoy the trip","Johannesburg, South Africa",10/3/2018
Corinthia Hotel London,5,The best in London,"The Corinthia is doubtfully the best hotel in London. Not only in terms of location and food but in service! We have experienced the most exclusive and honest service in a city hotel and not only. Staff are amazing, always happy to help, discrete, polite and very well trained. Congratulations to all the manager.","London, United Kingdom",7/2/2015
Ridgemount Hotel,4,"Great location, decent accommodations","This is a good, clean hotel in central London, close to everything, on bus lines, close to the underground, a short walk to the British Museum, and to a vast array of different restaurants. The staff are very helpful. The hotel has a lounge area with good wireless internet--I had a first floor room where I also had good wireless access, but my colleague, higher up, had to come to the lounge. The breakfast was good, plenty of food. The rooms are quite small, but I became quite attached to my tiny comfortable single. Bathrooms are roomy and clean, with a good shower. As others have said, well worth the money.",Minneapolis,3/9/2012
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,An oasis of tranquil luxury,"What a wonderful hotel!! My experience of London hotels is not great so I wasn't expecting much, but this one was a complete surprise - fantastic service, superb rooms, and a wonderful restaurant serving a delicious, quality dining experience. | When I arrived, the reception staff were very efficient and friendly, they really did seem to enjoy chatting and making the guest feel welcome. I was also offered a free room upgrade to a junior suite, which was a lovely touch that made me feel valued as a customer. | The junior suite was fantastic - very luxurious with a mini-bar, 2 40"" TVs with blue-ray players, a king-size bed, air conditioned, simply wonderful. The bathroom was also spacious with a large shower and separate bath. | I dined in the restaurant in the evening and again, I couldn't fault it - fast, friendly and attentive service and the food itself was very nicely presented, cooked perfectly and tasted great! The breakfast was also top class, with loads of choice and no quibbling over quantity. | Checkout just completed the whole experience, again being friendly and efficient. | I just felt pampered and valued through the whole stay, which combined with the quality of service and rooms, makes this hotel an oasis of pleasure in a sea of mediocre London hotels. | A little pricey perhaps, but definitely worth it.","Hartlepool, United Kingdom",7/24/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Perfect for a special occasion,"We went for a special occasion and came back full of beans and happy memories. The staff were friendly and switched on, and the hotel itself is stunning. We walked along the South Bank and into Soho for dinner, then back for cocktails in the Rumpus room, which feels like a fancy Manhattan bar. Great rooms and breakfast.","Petersfield, United Kingdom",1/23/2017
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Faultless Hotel,"My husband booked this hotel for a weekend get away. On arrival we were met and offered complimentary glasses of Prosecco. As we weren't intending to spend a lot of time in the room, we opted for the standard, double, room only basis. Could not fault the room! Complimentary crisps, sweets, biscuits and ELEMIS toiletries (as well as the renowned free Apex Duck!) Staff were exemplary, room spotless and location perfect walking distance to the Barbican and St Pauls Cathedral. All in all cannot wait to return, highly recommended!","Cambridge, United Kingdom",2/7/2016
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Family hotel with breakfast in good location,"Hotel is very quiet. Breakfast is tasty and big enough. But if you visit for a long time the same breakfast can be a little bit annoying. Breakfast is served by staff. Bathrooms are very clean. There are three U-stations around it - Goodge street, Russell Square and Euston Square. Bus station is in front of the hotel. There are free coffee and tea in a lounge room and drinks with very good prices. Only problem was hot weather in London in July. The temperature was 37C, so fans in rooms could not provide fresh air. Especially we would like to notice staff. They all were very helpful.","Yerevan, Armenia",10/12/2018
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",5,One of the best hotel experiences I've had,"First, the hotel's location is second to none. Behind the hotel, a three minute walk, is The Grenadier and Belgrave Park. Adjacent to Hyde Park, between the Lanesborough and The Berkeley, it is ideal. The rooms have been redone recently so very up-to-date and luxurious. The service was impeccable. Literally every member of the staff was very helpful, pleasant, and friendly. The restaurant was perfectly acceptable, and the bar (including the cigar bar) was among the best in London. | Value-wise the hotel is impossible to beat. I will absolutely stay there on my next visit",NA,7/21/2013
The Savoy,5,Excellent experience!!,"Two weeks ago, our daughter married in London, and we chose to stay at The Savoy during our visit. We booked a junior suite through Amex platinum hoping for an upgrade to a river view. Upon arrival, we were disappointed that no upgrade was available. The Savoy more than made up for that, by moving us the following day to a large one bedroom suite, which had more than ample room for the bride and her sister, along with me to have the stylist do all of our hair and makeup for the wedding, with plenty of room for my husband to relax and stay out of the happy fray. The suites come with a Butler and all hotel staff were trained impeccably to perform with an impressive standard of excellence! The hotel is beautiful and well located. We ate several meals on property, including room service- all were exceptionally wonderful. The hotel literally bent over to accommodate us in every way possible- including producing a beautifully wrapped package of rose petals to throw at the bride and groom after the ceremony, which was held off property! Our stay was heavenly! I look forward to returning to The Savoy when we come back to London!","Miami Beach, Florida",8/18/2015
The Savoy,5,Elegance at its Finest,"The Savoy is back--and better. From the moment you arrive and are escorted directly to your room, you know it's going to be a different experience. The butler soon arrived to offer his services (but no, I don't need help unpacking--seriously, people do that?). | The facilities, the room, the food and the service are unsurpassed. | My only complaint is all of the various room rates and upgrades. I didn't like my first room and and took quite some time to really understand what I was going to get with an upgrade. I did upgrade and received a beautiful Jr. Suite overlooking the Queen's chapel. I would suggest they just make the choices more simple. | The gym is pretty small but adequate. The ""pool"" is a large bathtub. | Otherwise, spectacular.",Denver,6/8/2011
The Dorchester,5,"Looked after impeccably, as usual","Having chosen to enter the London marathon we booked to stay in the Dorchester. | The first time we have stayed here for a specific event, other than just for shopping and spending time in London. | We were looked after with amazing care, as usual. | Complementary water, flapjacks, bananas etc were all waiting in reception for us to take on the way to the start. | The reception staff couldn't do enough, even printing out our result sheets from the marathon for us. | Thank you, once again, for making our time with you so memorable for the right reasons.","Cheltenham, United Kingdom",4/20/2014
The Dorchester,5,"""Quintessentially English"".",The Dorchester has and always will be my favourite London Hotel...It upholds all the elegance and sophistication that you would expect from a traditional english hotel...staff are eager to please...food is delicious...especially afternoon tea...linen etc is clean and crisp...and to enhance all its finery... to the degree which makes me never want to leave...are the lavishly arranged fragrant floral displays...I'm not surprised celebrities choose this establishment as their base when visiting the capital...why wouldn't you?...Kx,stockport,5/7/2013
The Savoy,5,Five Star Savoy,"We have stayed in some wonderful hotels in the USA and around the world, but the Savoy stands out as the best! The renovation has been worth the wait and the entire staff genuinely looked out for our welfare. The check-in, concierge, bell staff, and butlers pampered us and wished us to have an excellent stay. As a Fairmont President Club Member we were upgraded to a beautiful river view one bedroom suite. We were definitely spoiled and hope to return.","Westlake Village, California",8/28/2016
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",4,Good location and service for sure..,"I ve stayed at one of the suits rooms overlooking the park. It s difficult to find a hotel in London that has a nice unblocked view like this. So the location wise I liked it. The services in general were very good. They didn't have the tea or coffee pot that any hotels do have in the room but they brought that for me. The room itself was good too. The bed and bed linen was one of the best I found in London. I like the big bath tab too. | The big negative was that there is no gym, which is a standard in a luxury hotel nowadays. I was very disappointed as I didn't even think the hotel of this class would not have one. So I would not come back to this hotel again,","Singapore, Singapore",10/19/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Lovely weekend break,"My Husband and I stayed at the Mondrian for the first time in July.We enjoyed our stay so much we returned for my husbands birthday in September, the Mondrian is now the only place we would stay when visiting London. From the moment you check in staff are welcoming and helpful. The bars are both unique and a great place to relax and enjoy the views. If I was to find fault it would be hard and if anything very picky and it would be that I would have liked personally at breakfast some poached eggs and a sweet muffin as those I tried were more healthy than I would personally enjoy. However I am sure if I had asked the staff would have tried to accommodate my needs. If you staying for an occasion be sure to let staff know prior to your stay and you will be pleasantly surprised with a treat of a cocktail for you and your guest.","Peterborough, United Kingdom",9/29/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Best Hotel i have had the pleasure to stay at,"I chose the Apex London Wall hotel for 1 nights stay as part of a surprise anniversary present for our 1st wedding anniversary. | Where do i start the hotel staff are excellent, very courteous, helpful, and always aim to please or serve their customers. The reception staff made us feel welcome from the start allowing us to store our luggage way ahead of our room being ready and also allowed the use of a Massive umbrella for our journey to the Dominion theatre to we 'We Will Rock You' thanks to the typical british weather deciding to be the complete opposite to what it should be and rain. Before checking i had been in contact with them via email to request a room with a balcony area, if it was available and got an email back saying they would see what they could do - i have done this before and didn't think anything would come of it.... well i was wrong!!! and in a big way they gave us room on the top floor with a large corner terrace area, the beds were sooooo comfortable, the bose dock was a nice touch and the bathroom was very well fitted out - the bath was awesome. | They also went to the unrequested effort of hand writing a greetings card giving their wishes for our anniversary, which was a very nice touch indeed. | The 'Off The Wall' restaurant (which is part of the hotel and accessed from the reception area) is also a joyful experience with food to die for, all the staff made reference to our anniversary and seemed genuine in their wishes - it seemed as though they had communicated it to the staff, which was a very nice touch. I could go on all day but i best not and i would like to finish this review with one sentence.... | THANK YOU APEX LONDON WALL STAFF FOR THE BEST HOTEL EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD AND MAKING OUR ANNIVERSARY AS ENJOYABLE AS POSSIBLE""","Canvey Island, United Kingdom",8/25/2013
The Savoy,5,Bucket list stay of my dreams!,"I had the honour of staying at the beautifull Savoy hotel for the first time this weekend. I have never had such a warm and genuine welcome in my life! as i usually stay in cheaper hotels because of my budget, this was probably a once in a lifetime opportunity. I must say though that i might just save up a little more often so i can experience this luxury again. | From the moment i arrived, the charming and proffesional doormen welcomed me to the hotel. Sean Davoren was there at the entrance to take me to the reception for check in. I was met by Beatriz, Danja, Claudia, and others whos name escape me at the moment so i do apologise for that!! Every single staff member was so passionate and friendly.. i felt like a king arriving at his castle! | Beatriz has been absolutely amazing, she left lovely little notes in the suite and looked after me brilliantly. Mihai who looked after me in the evening was superb and Francis who served my breakfast was a true gentleman. The entire butler team has been inspiring and i am incredibly thankfull that i was able to enjoy their service. Sean Davoren is a true leader and has done incredible training his butlers. | Kaspars has been devine! the food was amazing, the hospitality that Peter and Miles showed was inspirational. Our waiter Jakob was very knowledgable and had just the right tone for the ambiance. He is a great example of perfect service! Also many thanks to Dominic and the other sommelier whos name escapes me. Both have been fantastic and poured some great wines! | Ofcourse i also want to thank Alice, Pippa and Chiara from the american bar. It was a dream of mine to enjoy the comfort of a great drink in the american bar and they have been most accomodating. my table request was even made possible and they were super charming! | The concierge team has been very kind aswell looking after my request to send some items home for me. They usually were the first persons to great me as i walked through the door and made me feel like i was coming home and i was part of the savoy family. | There are many other names that i wish to mention but there are too many to remember.. I have had the absolute best of times. Each individual member of staff is amazing. I want to thank you all once again for your hospitality and making me feel at home and part of your family. | thank you, thank you, thank you!",NA,2/20/2018
The Savoy,5,Best Stay In town,"The service, the Food the room all 100 % i simply can't fault The Savoy. i have stayed all over the world and paid huge sums. The Savoy is, in my mind the level that all Hotels should be judged. when we stay in the City for work or to just to take in a show we always choose The Savoy","London, United Kingdom",11/8/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,The best hotel,"This is the third time my wife and I have stayed at the Corinthia. I am not sure why I have not reviewed it before. It is without doubt the best hotel we have stayed in. Everything is superb to the minutest detail. The staff are fantastic, superbly turned out, and as polite and helpful and one could wish them to be. | The hotel itself is luxury personified. The entrance hall bedecked in marble sets the scene for what awaits you. On this occasion we were treated with a complimentary double upgrade (subject to availability) and had a beautiful room with a balcony on the courtyard garden. Again everything is just superb and it's difficult to find sufficient superlatives to describe how good everything is. | We made full use of the Thermal Floor, which my wife (who is an expert in the Beauty trade) tells me is the best Spa she has been in. Our package included a treatment each as well, and as one would suspect, we weren't disappointed. The therapists were outstanding. | Make no mistake, this a luxury hotel with prices to match and it's a 'special occasion' hotel for us but it's well worth saving up for the experience. There are many luxury hotels in London but we have no wish to try the others now, this one is too good!",NA,11/30/2015
The Savoy,5,Flawless,"I could not imagine a more perfect location for a visit to London. Located in the center of the West End, 1 tube stop or a 15 minute walk to Westminster and 2 blocks fro Covent Garden it is in the center of everything. The hotel staff is very helpful - you could not ask for more attentive staff. The rooms are very well appointed (hotel was remodeled in 2010). Do not miss The American Bar.","Houston, TX",7/14/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Fantastic hotel,"I got engaged here this month, everything was fabulous. | While we Stayed at the hotel we used the spa, hairdressers &amp; also had afternoon tea. | Never seen an Indian or Chinese breakfast in a hotel in the uk before, temped to go back just for breakfast select alone. Yummy! | This hotel Should be a 6-7 star ;)","Leicester, United Kingdom",2/24/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,One night stay to see a TV Show,"Choose this hotel due to its location to ITV Studios, and was not disappointed with our choice. From the moment we arrived, we was treated really well, we arrived a little early, and was going to leave our bag at check in, but a room was available. | Room was really nice, very modem. Could not fault it, oh and bed was really really comfy. | Did not have a meal in hotel, but we did have drinks at both bars, rooftop bar had great views of the River Thames at night. | Would visit again.","Barnsley, United Kingdom",4/17/2015
The Savoy,5,Muy buen hotel pero....,"Me parece que es un muy buen hotel pero han cambiado el rumbo de la línea que siempre tuvo. | Ahora, me parece por lo que me tocó ver, que prefieren el volumen a la calidad del turismo. | Muchos grupos de convencionistas, todos los restaurantes y bares del hotel así como él tea room siempre llenos y como sucede cuando hay estos eventos, se convierte en un lugar ruidoso. | El restaurante Kaspers bueno y ya, el bar incómodo y ruidoso.",NA,3/10/2016
The Savoy,5,Super Hotel an toller Lage,"Tolles Hotel in London, an super Lage. Alles kann Fussläufig sehr gut erreicht werden. Tolles Frühstück mit old British Service. Alles im Hotel ist neu renoviert und wunderschön hergerichtet worden. Der Spa / pool Bereich ist etwas klein aber völlig ausreichend für ein City Hotel. Unbedingt die Bar ausprobieren!","Zurich, Switzerland",1/17/2012
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Fantastic stay,"The staff at the Apex London Wall are nothing short of fantastic. | When my wife and I arrived for a weekend in early October, she was not feeling well. The staff recognized this and upgraded us to a larger room so she would have more space in which to get more comfortable. They remembered and even checked on her throughout the weekend. | The room was very large and very comfortable. | The only negative for us was the extremely loud bar downstairs. It appears to be a popular after-work place with the financial types in the area (Blackrock is across the street). The music was loud, but the food was very good. | We'd stay here again in a heartbeat.","Bedford, Indiana",11/3/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Buen hotel buena ubicación,"Exelente ubicación a un lado de nueva galería Tate para turismo con un servicio discreto. Instalaciones agradables Diseño interesante, moderno pero funcional. Precio razonable El personal de recepcion realmente atentos. Una muy buena opción en Londres","Cuernavaca, Mexico",6/24/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Elegant inner city hotel,"A sophisticated hotel ideally positioned for proximity to the major tourist attractions and also close to the city for business, we found the location ideal and were able to walk to most attractions. Catching a cab to the further away locations was easy and a short trip. Service was generally excellent as was the room. We recommend requesting a room on a high floor and we looked out on Whitehall which was quiet. Rooms are a very good size. We enjoyed meals at both Northall and Massimos. Food at both was excellent and the staff knowledgeable. We specially would like to compliment the doorman who was of great assistance when taxi's were in short supply. We would recommend the hotel for couples and business travellers.","Auckland, New Zealand",8/18/2015
The Rembrandt,4,Great Hotel !!!,I Was in this hotel a few years ago with my family and I must say we enjoyed it: the staff Was very friendly and efficient; the rooms were clean and tidy; the breakfast was plentiful. Convenient to all service. Excellent quality / price.,"Rivoli, Italy",2/10/2016
Rhodes Hotel,2,Disappointing,"I read the reviews and contacted the hotel directly before booking. In acknowledgement, Reception emailed me that I would have a room in a newly remodeled annex. | We were given a room in the main building. There was a hole in the ceiling, the drapes were filthy, and there was nothing about the room or amenities which justified good reviews. In the morning we followed the instructions we'd been shown the night before on using the shower, but it only spewed out scalding water. I explained this when we checked out, but the man at the desk insisted that we hadn't operated the shower properly.","Suffield, Connecticut",10/7/2017
Rhodes Hotel,4,Does exactly what it says on the tin.,"I stayed for one night. The reception area is a bit bizarre but the guy on the desk was nice and welcoming. | My room wasn't in the hotel itself but in their other building round the corner which was fine for me but might get tiresome on a long stay, especially in bad weather. | Room was small to say the least, but was very clean and the bed was comfy. | Breakfast room was a bit cramped, but service was fine and breakfast was enough to set me up. | In short, this place is great if you want a bed for the night which is clean and functional. It is very close to Paddington Station so makes a convenient stop over. | Luxury it is not. Wifi was free, but very slow.","Gloucestershire, United Kingdom",6/17/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Great hotel for a frequent visitor,"I travel frequently to London and have generally stayed in the hotels near Hyde Park along Park Lane. A friend suggested this hotel and it was a very good decision to try it out. The hotel is very upmarket with high end finishings throughout the lobby and the rooms. Service was pleasant and prompt, and I would rate it well above average for London hotels. I loved the room which was very spacious, including a separate dressing room with ample storage for clothes as well as luggage. The bathroom was also luxurious and I must admit I enjoyed the bath with the LED TV. My room was silent at night allowing for an uninterupted nights sleep. The location is very good but I would caution that it is in close proximity to a high trafficed tourist area (Trafalgar Square/Leicester Square) which can be very crowded on weekends and evenings. Also, I did find I had to walk closer to Covenant Garden to get access to good restaurants/bars. But, for business meetings, Embankment Tube station is right out the door and offers easy access to the City. | I did try the Northall restaurant in the hotel, although I ordered from the adjacent bar. Food was good, expensive as expected. I didn't try the Italian restaurant.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",9/19/2012
The Rembrandt,5,tolle Unterkunft an ausgezeichneter Lage,"Im ruhigen South Kensington unweit der U-Bahn Station gelegen, ist man rasch an den schönsten Orten von London. Das Früstücksbuffet ist wirklich grosszügig und umfassend. Die Zimmer entsprechen dem gewünschten Standard. Bei einem erneuten Londonaufenthalt wäre das Rembrandt erste Wahl.",Allschwil,9/10/2012
The Savoy,5,My favourite Hotel in London,"This is my favourite hotel in London. Beautiful decor, staff, rooms and the cocktail bars are incredible. Its worth every penny to stay here. | The staff always go over and above to do anything for you which is to me a sign of a very good hotel. | The rooms are beautiful and the beds are the best hotel beds Ive ever slept in. | I would highly recommend a stay here or coming here for afternoon tea, which is also incredible.","Brighton, United Kingdom",6/13/2018
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Stylish hotel in a great location,"We stayed just before Christmas for a trip to the Globe Theatre. It is ideally located for this and we enjoyed a great stay. Girl on reception was really friendly, welcoming and talkative whilst being efficient and the room was good too. | The hotel was full of people on office parties so there were a few people rather drunk and the bar was rammed so we avoided that and the drunks too! We used the restaurant for lunch which is expensive but good - the sharing plates are actually good value. | Overall, enjoyed the stay and would use it again.",Essex,12/29/2014
London Guest House,4,"Quiet, clean, comfortable hotel","I stayed for 1 night in a single room which although compact was well appointed. My room was very quiet and the bed comfortable. Breakfast was self service (toast, pastries, scrambled eggs, beans, yogurts, fruit juice) in a light and airy dining room. | The hotel is on the 266 bus route, convenient for both North Acton and Hammersmith. Excellent map provided when you book showing bus stops and stations. Plenty of shops nearby. | Staff were all helpful, late check in was no problem.","Yorkshire, England",3/5/2014
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",3,"Nice staff,clean,good location but TINY rooms with no place to put catkin or stuff","Great location but extremely tiny rooms. Also very helpful staff and some nice amenities,such as bathrobes. But the room is disappointing as it is too too small. No space to hardly open up suitcase - which is where you will have to keep all your clothing because there are no drawers and closet is minuscule. Probably would not recommend to others. I am currently starting here.",NA,3/27/2014
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Lovely Hotel,"Really enjoyed my stay here. I booked a junior suite that had enough space for my adult daughter and I to comfortably settle in. Furnishings were very nice,bathroom big and the shower was great. The staff was friendly and eager to please. Located near the Moorgate (five minutes) and Liverpool (ten minutes) tube stops, making it easy to get most anywhere, One downside: there is not much going on in the immediate vicinity of the hotel except some very busy pubs,and a couple of chain restaurants, but those all go dark on the weekends. However, you can walk about ten minutes to Spitalfields Market and there is more action around there - the walk back can seem a little lonely, though, if you are by yourself. Overall, recommended.",Los Angeles,10/10/2012
The Savoy,5,wow what a wonderful hotel,"We stayed at this fabulous hotel for my birthday last year and had a great time. | We were given a free upgrade with a view of the Thames , Big Ben and the London eye. | A small birthday cake was awaiting me when we came back to the room. | The evening entertainment was super with piano ,saxophone and a singer. | If your a resident , you can get a table before others not cheap as doubles only but well worth it,.",Great Britian,10/1/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,"Modern, Centrally Located 5-Star Hotel","My wife and I returned to London for a special occasion and were very pleased with the location, accommodations and staff at the Mondrian London. Hamish, Luke and the rest of the staff we encountered went out of their way to ensure we had a memorable visit. We will definitely stay there when visit London again. Many thanks.","Buffalo, New York",8/9/2015
The Rembrandt,4,Very nice - exceptional service,"Stayed for 5 days with my son. Breakfast was excellent, rooms a bit on the small side but VERY comfortable beds. Concierge service was very attentive nd helpful in scheduling tours and with recommendations. Only concerns were we did not get wake up call as requested and beds were not changed unless requested after several times. Location is excellent, centric for buses, trains, walking at any hour. Definitely recommendable.","Seattle, Washington",10/25/2012
Rhodes Hotel,4,Location couln't be better,"As most writers here, we truly enjoyded our stay at Rhodes Hotel. The location is excellent, just two blocks from Paddington Station and Hyde Park. Our room was small, but we knew that in advance so it wasn't disappointing (we are a family of five, and it is really hard to find a hotelroom for that many). It was really hot in London, so it was nice to have air-conditioning in the room plus fridge for cold drinks. The bathroom was very modern. Breakfast was ok, and when we had to leave really early to fly home, we got some breakfast to our room the night before. This hotel gives value fot the money, and we are already planning our next stay there.",Finland,7/2/2009
The Dorchester,5,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"We booked afternoon tea on the Balcony at the Dorchester for our Wedding Anniversary. I have to say it was simply fantastic. Vintage Champagne on arrival, Silver Service from our personal waiter, fabulous sandwiches prepared by the chef, beautiful cakes &amp; scones. All in all a really great experience. Nothing was to much trouble, plenty of food as well. We've had afternoon tea in several places, but have never been offered 2nd's, &amp; 3rd's of all of the courses !! To cap it all, as we were preparing to leave, we were presented with the most perfect cake with anniversary wishes from the chef &amp; staff. | Clearly The Dorchester is not the cheapest place in town, but the whole experience made the expence well worth it.","Chester, United Kingdom",3/10/2015
The Rembrandt,3,Do not settle for second best,"We chose this hotel as it was well situated for our needs. In addition, my sister had stayed at the Rembrandt several times before and highly recommended it. | I paid a little extra to have a deluxe/superior room however, what we got was a misshapen corner room with little room to move. If my sister was in bed with her knees up I could not see the TV. I was bitterly disappointed. | We spoke to reception who showed me two other rooms which were worlds apart from my room. Why did they stick me in this horrible room when they had other, nicer rooms which apparently the same standard as mine. Were they heck! They were 100% more superior. Nicer furnishings, bigger and better appointed. | This being said there was one MAJOR issue. When we arrived in the new room we left our stuff and when to the bar for a drink. When we got back to the room later that night we had a quick explore. My sister opened a door which led straight through to the next room where a couple were fast asleep. Not only was the room not locked but we were able to get into their room. They could have come into our room whilst we were out and stolen anything! | They need to sort this out. | Anyway, the bar area was good, the food was lovely and the afternoon tea was very good. But at £250 for a double room for one night I feel robbed for the amount of disruption there was. We complained to the manager who offered me 25% off my next stay. What a load of tosh. Next stay? I don't think so .................",Surrey,8/5/2013
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Hôtel très agréable et bien placé avec un excellent accueil,"Très bien situé dans le quartier de bloomsbury, à 10 minutes de la gare TGV de St Pancras, cet hôtel offre des chambres familiales de taille correcte, pratique, propreté impeccable. Petit bémol, la salle de bains un petit peu vétuste. | Il permet d'aller rapidement en bus (le 24) vers Soho, Covent Garden, Trafalgar, Big Ben,... | Le personnel est très accueillant et donne beaucoup de conseils (restaurants, visites,...) | PC disponible dans la salle commune pour surfer sur Internet. | Le petit déjeuner est le classique breakfast anglais avec oeufs-bacon, céréales, café/the/chocolat et toasts. Rien à redire | Après 3 nuits passées, je le recommande pour son rapport qualité/prix (moins de £100) pour une chambre familiale (Voir mon avis sur un autre hôtel Luna&amp;Simone).",Ile de France,3/29/2009
Rhodes Hotel,3,Comfortable,Nice value for money | Great breakfast | Staff extremely kind and helpful | Great exercise walking up the stairs | Really close to train station an restaurants | After finding out I was Australian the next morning they offered vegemite as a choice of spread.,Dublin,8/20/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Absolutely perfect,"The Mondrian rearranged a booking I made by accident when they were under absolutely no obligation to fix my mistake. The visit itself was also great, lovely room with a bit of a view and the service was good. | Special mention to the breakfast that came with the room; looking out over St Paul's is something I'll never forget. | We were already repeat visitors due to the location and I suspect we'll be back again after the help I got this time round. Cannot say enough good things about this place.","Berkhamsted, United Kingdom",4/11/2017
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,thouroughly enjoyed my stay,"I really enjoyed my stay here, the drinks at the bar were a little bit pricey, but what else would you expect staying in this gorgeous hotel and in the middle of london. The rooms were really nice very comfortable. The friends that we went with upgraded to a room with a seperate living area which was great. The bathrooms were amazing really spacious and the free shampoo etc was elemis, very nice!!!!! | Really enjoyed it here would definitely come back again. Thankyou",Kent,8/1/2010
The Dorchester,5,Soggiorno perfetto,"L'HOTEL | RECEPTION attiva 24/24h, check-in rapidissimo | L'hotel si trova in un CONTESTO circondato dal verde (Green Park è a due passi), in cui si può apprezzare il fatto di non uscire e trovarsi subito nella caotica quotidianità londinese | La STRUTTURA è imponente e maestosa, classica, ma con un tocco di modernità | Gli INTERNI sono decisamente sfarzosi e lussuosi, rispecchiano appieno lo stile Dorchester che si può notare anche al Principe di Savoia ad esempio | Il PERSONALE è gentilissimo nonché disponibilissimo praticamente ad ogni ora del giorno e della notte | CAMERE | La nostra CAMERA era decisamente confortevole, con un mini ingresso che conduceva da una parte al bagno e dall'altra alla spaziosissima camera con il suo enorme letto matrimoniale. | Prese della corrente solo con spina inglese, però con adattatori gentilmente forniti dalla struttura. | Frigo Bar molto ricco e vario. | Il BAGNO abbastanza grande, rivestito interamente in marmo, con una comoda vasca da bagno, doppio lavandino, e pieno di asciugamani morbidissimi. Unica nota negativa, solo 2 accappatoi per 3 persone. | CIBO | La COLAZIONE era incredibilmente buona e ricca. | Succo a scelta, uova cucinate a proprio piacimento con accompagnamento di svariate cose (bacon, salsiccia, funghi, hash browns, sanguinaccio e altro), muesli/granola con yogurt o latte, pane tostato e croissant in gran quantità, carpaccio di frutta, più chiaramente una bevanda calda a scelta. | L'ultima sera abbiamo usufruito del bar ordinando del Whisky: non tantissima scelta (3 tipi soltanto) e quindi abbiamo puntato su un Johnnie Walker Black Label. | In generale posso dire che ho avuto una bellissima esperienza al Dorchester. A Londra è sicuramente la scelta migliore che si possa fare per un breve soggiorno città. | CONSIGLIATO!!!","Milan, Italy",5/9/2017
The Savoy,5,"""A big warm hug...""","When you are a young person, and you have to stay inside for years for a disease you didn't asked for, that makes you even more ill. But as i allways say : if you can dream it you can do it! And it helped : hearing from doctors i am getting better which meant i can go outside and going on holliday...wow! | From the moment i heard this, i opened my laptop and booked eurostar tickets to go to one of my favourite cities in the world, london...but this was going to be totally different. I wanted and needed to treat myself, as i didnt had the opportunity the last years to do this. So i went looking for a nice looking hotel, and if possible one with an atmosphere which screams luxury, but the most of all quietness. To much noise or a to busy lobby would make me ill and actually really quickly i ended up with the savoy. Reading the amazing reviews and watching amazing pictures of the hotel wanted me to make a reservation and without thinking to much about the price, i just did it! | And from that moment, i was stepping into a dream. Having really warm conversations trough email with the staff of the hotel ( thank you hannah) for being sure everything would be perfect for by the time i would arrive, this was very promising. I wasn't the most easy guest i think, asking a few requests like having a quiet room, if possible a spacious room and a late checkout as this would only help to make myself stress- free and never the staff reacted as they found this ridiculous. They actually understood how i must be feeling and how important this stay was. | And gosh, my arrival was more then perfect. A lovely doormen, taking directly my suitcases and opening the doors of the hotel to send me to another amazing friendly staffmember who directly welcomed me by saying ""wonderfull to have you here mr. Vermeersch"". A bit tired of my journey, but my excitement helped me trough this and after having a little tour of the hotel, with lots of ""oohs"" and ""woows"" of being overwhelmed, it got even to another higher level of service as they said they would call my butler...""my butler?"" , I said, ""yes, we are delighted to offer you one of our suites"" ...so by the time i arrived at my room, the butler was standing there waiting to give me a tour of the room. While he was going to get some tea, all kind of words kept passing me by : Big, luxurious, detailed,overwhelmed, wonderfull, comfy, ...and what a room! ThEy really helped me with offering this spacious room, as this creates a more relaxing atmosphere , although a standard room would have made me allready happy. So i can't thank the wonderfull staff enough for making my important requests reality. Each second i was enjoying my stay, from going to the public toilets ( where they gave you soap and towels before you were able to get it yourself) to having a nice cocktail in the american bar ( altough the ober didn't want to bring us with 3 persons twice the same cocktail as he found this stupid, he wanted everyone to take an other one...found this a bit rude ) to even the most important and amazing thing : each staffmember you are passing by greeting you with a spontanious and friendly ""hi sir"" or ""how do you do"". | As you can hear, this hotel has everything you want and really made me feel special. At one point i had to pinch myself this was really happening : me having a HOLIDAY, in LONDON, In the SAVOY...without becoming ill ( as i have to watch out) so i can only end up by saying savoy will be a memory i will never forget and even further : it gave me the sparkle again in my eyes i had lost over the past years because of my disease, the sparkle of the happy niek who i was used to be. | So the only way to end properly with this review is by saying : | ""A big warm hug"", that's what i would like to give each staffmember the next time i will be staying here. | Ps : as i must enjoy the fact i'm getting better, that will be sooner then i would have been able to imagine --&gt; you see me back in december gorgeous savoy ;-) | Kindest greets to everyone and thank you ! | Niek vermeersch","Gent, Oost-Vlaanderen, Belgium",8/29/2013

The Rembrandt,5,"Comfortable rooms, great position",This hotel was booked at the last minute for a business trip. The rate was very good value for money. The hotel itself is conveniently situated opposite the V&amp;A and Natural History Museum and just a couple of minutes walk from South Kensington tube. Having not stayed in this area for many years it was a pleasant suprise to see all of the beautiful Victorian and Georgian buildings in this area looking so stunning. | The staff were helpful and efficient and check in very quick. My room (a club room) was fantastic.. It looked as though it had hardly been used it was so clean. Enough space to feel comfortable in and well designed furnishings. The bed was as comfortable as any hotel bed I have slept in and the hot air heating was so quiet you could not tell it was on... Such a change from some of the rattling systems that you find even in new hotels. the bathroom was exceptional. Spotless.. a double shower and a jacuzzi bath with showerhead... it felt like home from home.. once again it was so clean it felt like no one had used it before. | Breakfast was tasty and good quality.. the only slight downside was that the breakfast room was packed and the staff were struggling to keep up with the ever growing number of guests. they worked very hard and remained polite but there was sweat rolling down the faces of everyone working there.. not quite what you want to look at first thing in the morning.. Maybe 2 or 3 more serving staff would help.,"Stafford, United Kingdom",12/6/2013
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,A stylish hotel with good service and a great location,Stayed here on business for a week. | Room was comfortable and well appointed. | The hotel is a great location to access London and many of the sights. | Service was good. | Hotel breakfast was good quality but there was a limited selection of cooked options available at the buffet and oddly no granular sugar (for cereal) or pepper on the tables. | Perhaps an issue of form over function ! Nonetheless a pleasant stay and would happily stay again.,"Maidenhead, United Kingdom",2/8/2016
The Savoy,1,Ripped Off,The most ridiculous prices for anything over the regular room rate I have ever experienced. I liked the way we were checked in. When we complained about wrongful charges we were treated poorly........,Denver,7/15/2014
The Dorchester,3,Déçue par l'accueil....,"L'afternoon Champagne Tea était bien, rien à dire. Les patisseries excellentes. Le service sympathique. Pourtant l'accueil n'a pas été à la hauteur d'un 5 étoiles. Personne ne nous a débarrassé de nos manteaux..... qui sont restés sur les fauteuils.... Pas très élégants me semble-t-il.....","Quinta do Lago, Portugal",1/21/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Has to be the best in London,"Once you've experienced Corinthia London, there is no going back. After a wonderful stay last June for our Anniversary/Husband's birthday, we simply had to return this year. | Everything I said in my last review still stands: in my opinion, this hotel cannot be beaten. It comes at a price, but we feel that price is worth it for the overall superb experience you receive. It goes way beyond a room for the night for us. The bathroom is a highlight, and I spend as much time as possible in the amazing tub, with TV, whilst sipping on the Champagne that we added onto our booking. The general amenities are also top notch. | We arrived early, but as we had plans did not need access to our room - instead, we said we'd prefer to be able to checkout late the next day after a business lunch in the Northall, which they duly noted. We had been told we'd received a double upgrade to a room on the 6th floor, (upgrades, where available, are one of the benefits when booking directly with the hotel). When we returned that afternoon, we were given a different room on the 7th floor. Not sure what room type it was, and we did miss the larger bed we had last time, but as with all rooms at Cornthia, it was supremely comfortable and this particular one had a view to die for whilst in London, and did allow us the aforementioned late checkout the following afternoon. | We enjoyed the spa, the Bassoon Bar, the Northall - (which is always a highlight for us). The food, ambience and service are perfect in there, and it's always on our if we visit London, even just for the day. | Would we go back? Absolutely: I think it will become a yearly tradition - with more stays in between if time, babysitting Grandparents and funds allow!","Southampton, United Kingdom",8/20/2015
London Guest House,5,Bargain!,"Wanted to take my son to London and do the tourist thing but didnt want to spend a fortune. This little B&amp;B was just the ticket, great price and a fantastic little room. The staff were very friendly, the rooms were well presented, feshly cooked breakfast in the morning, and free off road parking as well!! About a 15 minute walk from Acton tube station, so getting around was really easy too! Couldnt recommend this place more, if light on the wallet but not a dive is what youre looking for then this is the place for you.",NA,6/17/2018
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,EXCELLENT PROPERTY,"I was there on business with about 10 other colleagues. I had never been to London and was not sure about location, property, etc. The hotel was awesome and the staff was impeccable! Everyone was so incredibly helpful even with all of my last minute requests. Food and cocktails were great! The location was perfect!!! I will definitely stay there again.","Plano, Texas",3/31/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,2,Is this really a Morgans Hotel?!,"Having stayed at several Morgans Hotels on both sides of the pond, I was really looking forward to checking in to the Mondrian London. | I have to say I was bitterly disappointed and left questioning whether this hotel was actually a Morgans property. | Normally the second you step into any Morgans property, you instantly know youre in a Morgans Hotel. They always have the wow factor &amp; the décor has such a quirky, distinctive style, and the service is always exemplary without being stuffy. The same cannot be said about Mondrian London- we could have been in any generic high-end hotel in the world, and some of the staff behaviour we witnessed was highly sub-standard. | The room was nice, but nice is not a word I would normally use to describe a Morgans room- its usually amazing, iconic, incredible. It was stylish but had no soul &amp; décor wise we could have been in a room in any hotel in the world. However the view of the Thames &amp; St Pauls was fantastic and was a redemptive feature &amp; the large marble bathroom, which is synonymous with Morgans was amazing &amp; without doubt the highlight of the room. | The bed was enormous, but was so hard it was like sleeping on breeze blocks- possibly one of the worst nights sleep Ive ever had- had to get up in the night &amp; go &amp; sleep on the couch- not really what you expect from a £500 room. | We had aperitifs in the Dandelyan bar- again the décor is completely unremarkable- nothing special when compared to the likes of the groups other bars, but was comfortable enough. We had really high hopes for this bar, as it is apparently run by an award winning mixologist, so we couldnt wait to sample to cocktails- and wait we did- while we pored over the enormous, incomprehensible menu. It was more like a botanical reference book than a cocktail menu- gargantuan in size and too wordy with no comprehensible flow. People know what they like to drink- either in terms of the spirit base of their cocktail (vodka, rum, gin, whiskey), or the type of drink they prefer (martini, flute, long etc..), therefore it is a sensible idea to arrange menus in a way that people can easily access the information they are looking for, as most high end places do. We got so fed up of trying to look for something suitable that we gave up &amp; ordered a glass of Champagne- which was served warm &amp; flat!!!! Quite ironic that these supposed award winning bartenders, werent even able to get a glass of Champagne right! But the waitress- not sure of her name, but she was of an eastern heritage- was very welcoming and friendly with a constant smile, so made up for the poor drinks. | We went through to dinner, and it was fantastic, the food was all executed perfectly &amp; really tasty &amp; well presented. Service was also very good, but we found the waiter to be quite formal and stiff which was quite surprising in a Morgans. He was very efficient and slick, but wasnt very engaging and definitely needed to smile more. The décor of the restaurant was very elegant and had great views across the Thames. There was a clear managerial presence on the floor, which always instils confidence in you as a diner. The Irish manager checked on our table, and the other tables around us, a touch that was very much appreciated. Breakfast was also excellent there. I would wholeheartedly recommend the Sea Containers restaurant, as a stand-alone venue. | We had drinks up at the Rumpus Room &amp; were welcomed by a very colourful character who instantly put a smile on our faces &amp; gave us a very warm welcome (not sure if he was the manager or host- gentleman with a beard &amp; earrings). Again the bar was nice décor wise, it had a classy feel to it &amp; the views across the Thames were spectacular. This time we opted to sit at the bar, so we could speak to the bartenders about the drinks &amp; avoid another negative experience like we had in Dandelyan. We were served by great bartender- cant recall his name- blue eyed chap who I believe told us he was from Hungary. He was friendly &amp; chatty &amp; made us feel welcome without being intrusive. He made us some bespoke cocktails based on our preferences, which were exquisite. Faith restored, we opted to order the next round from the menu- big mistake- they pre make their cocktails in batches &amp; literally just pour it out of a bottle onto ice!!! You may expect this kind of cutting corners from a high-volume, low-end venue, but we certainly did not expect this from a supposed high-end cocktail bar in a luxury hotel!!!! When you are paying around £15 for a cocktail, plus service charge, you expect your drinks to be freshly made &amp; for there to be a bit more service than simply opening a bottle! I couldnt believe what I was seeing! The bartender made us some more bespoke cocktails instead, which again were great- if you visit this bar ask for the bartenders to make you something based on your likes &amp; avoid their menu. We moved to a table &amp; had several different waitresses check on us &amp; serve us, all of whom were friendly &amp; attentive. | The ambience was good in the bar &amp; it is great for people watching, but one thing we did notice, which we thought was highly inappropriate was the lady with the short hair &amp; American accent -not sure what her role was but she seemed to work there, as went behind the bar &amp; was talking (well shouting across the room actually) to all the other staff- openly imbibing in the bar! In our experience of high end hotels, the staff dont normally openly drink to the point of belligerence in front of the guests during hours of service, so we were quite shocked by this &amp; didnt think having a drunk member of staff on the floor was acceptable. So this &amp; the pre made cocktails let this bar down &amp; clouded our otherwise good experience. | Overall I would say this hotel &amp; its facilities are mediocre at best. They are ok, but when you are paying five star prices, you expect a five star experience. If you are a Morgans aficionado like me, then avoid this place and stay at Sanderson or St Martins Lane instead, where you will receive the full Morgans experience. | But I would certainly recommend the Sea Containers restaurant, excellent food &amp; good service in a beautiful location. | And if you dont mind a drunken member of staff shouting across the room &amp; having to sit at the bar to order with the bartenders, then I would also recommend Rumpus Room.","London, United Kingdom",6/14/2016
The Lanesborough,5,Perfect tranquility,"Just had a wonderful overnight stay at the Lanesborough and it was wonderful. | The style of the hotel was lovely, we think regency, and so peaceful. | All the staff were attentive but not over the top. From the door men who took our bags from us on arrival (and at midnight when we came back from an event laden down with goodies) to the very friendly receptionist (Jamie or Janie we think her name was) who booked up in before showing us to our room. Then we were greeted by the butler Eve who explained their service which included a complementary clothes pressing if needed (we took advantage as my dress shirt had not travelled well). | We enjoyed lunch at Celeste and several cocktails in the Library Bar. | All in all a wonderful stay, thank you.","Banbury, United Kingdom",10/28/2016
The Rembrandt,5,So happy with The Rembrandt!,"This was my 2nd trip to London. This hotel was excellent! Landed in Heathrow and took the tube right to S. Kensington stop. It was a 5 minute walk to The Rembrandt. Check in was quick and nice. Harrods is a 10 minute walk down the street. Near the tube station there was a cute square with a dozen restaurants and bars. And with the tube so close all of London was at our fingertips. You MUST go to the hotel bar. Excellent service, friendly wait staff. They knew our names after one visit and remembered what we drank. You just go visit them! The daily breakfast that was free was perfect. Just enough choices to hold us over until lunch out. It was a nice addition to our stay. Our phone charger didn't work and the front desk was nice enough to let us borrow one for our trip. The room was cute and clean. Spotless actually. Quiet as well. I literally cannot say anything bad about our stay. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!","New Jersey, United States",4/18/2014
Rhodes Hotel,3,Wait until after Nov 2017,"We booked this hotel in April and visited in late September. The hotel is under remodel- the dining room is closed, there are remodeling supplies all about and the exterior is covered in scaffolding. The breakfast is provided in your room fridge- yogurt, cheese, breads, fruit and tea or coffee. That was actually quite convenient. | The room we had was around the block from the building. There was constant pounding, sanding, banging, singing and cell phone ringing from about 0730 to 1700 each day so don't plan a lie-in or a nap during the day. The receptionist/bell boy/handyman (came to fix our sink drain) said it should be done at November so we'd recommend calling before booking. | All that said, the place was dead silent at night, which was grand, and in a most wonderful spot for touristing. Very close to parks, tubes, Paddington and Oxford Street. | There are so many hotels in this area, we will look at others the next time we visit.","Broomfield, Colorado",10/1/2017
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Good business hotel in City,"I stayed at the Apex London Wall for one night and it was very good. Helpful service and everything you need for a business stay with complimentary wi-fi and short walk to everything within the City. The room was a bit small, but very comfortable beds and new interior and bathroom facilities. I can recommend this hotel for future guests.","Oslo, Norway",1/8/2013
The Savoy,5,Impecable Service,"Never have I ever stayed in an establishment with so many members of staff so willing to help, and so kind and friendly whilst doing so. I must especially mention Tom at the concierge desk, he went to great lengths to help me plan a lovely weekend of activities for my partner and I. The concierge team are all fabulous, and if you are staying in this wonderful hotel, make sure to make full use of their amazing connections and knowledge. Thank-you!","Leeds, United Kingdom",3/17/2013
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,excellent hotel,"fabulous Hotel......... great location and brilliant staff... | don't miss the cocktail bar and the champagne bar on the roof.. Wonderful abiance and layout, very stylish and chic hotel. Only slight criticism there was some very slight confusion on using the lift? But this is very minor and once we knew what we were doing not an issue. Brilliant hotel. | Well worth a visit or two!! |",Shropshire,7/28/2015
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Not sure I want to share..............,What a triumph. This is one of the best hotel experiences I have had. The Apex London Wall is well situated in the heart of the financial district. The position is quiet and off the main drag. Five minutes walk to two different tube stations offering a great availability of lines. The welcome was warm and efficient and the room superb. Everything good quality and comfortable. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant as it is so easy to wander into the city but we did try room service and it was spot on. | This hotel has the formula of price v location v services just right. I hope it stays this way as it makes a refreshing change.,"Shrewsbury, United Kingdom",5/3/2012

The Savoy,2,Not good enough!,"It was a special day out for my elderly Mothers Birthday which started off nicely . The staff were delightful BUT the tea experience was not. It started off ok with lovely sandwiches then went downhill very fast. After we had eaten the sandwiches and scone we were ignored for about 30 minutes - we looked around the room and nobody had been offered a pastry and our waiter was nowhere to be seen. Eventually a tray of pastries arrived and we felt we should only choose 1 or maybe 2 in the hope the tray would return shortly to offer you some more but sadly that didn't happen. After another 20-30 mins we were asked if we were ready for a piece of cake. Unfortunately it was just too late and the moment had past as after an hour and 45 we had waited around for too long. I asked for the cake to be boxed to take home only to be told they have changed the policy and you can't take anything with you. I have to say I was shocked - as we regularly visit hotels in London who kindly box some pastries for you to take home which is part of the tea experience. So for £50 plus service we had sandwiches , a scone and a pastry which frankly is appalling ! I was so upset that I called the manager who apologised but it was too late and my Mothers Birthday treat was ruined !",Bucks,7/7/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,"Stunning hotel, great location, relaxing spa facilities","My husband booked this hotel for my birthday in June. Being pregnant, I asked him to look for somewhere with a pool so we could relax after hectic days in the city. Little did he know that it actually had a full on spa area complete with an extra large jacuzzi, sauna, steam room and heated beds! This was definitely our favorite part of the hotel and we spent as much time down there as we could when we weren't out doing things. | Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly doormen who took our luggage for us. Check is was quick and smooth- the lady tending to us was both polite and friendly. Our room was ready so we were able to freshen up before heading out to lunch. The room was lovely, just as we would expect from a 5 star hotel. Very clean, the bed was comfy, bathroom was large with a big walk in shower one side and a big bath the other side. Turn down service was great! One night we were left a luxury chocolate each and the next a relaxing lavender pouch. These were nice touches. | Breakfast both mornings was fab- good selection and other things made to order if requested. | Again, the spa area was lovely and very relaxing. The only strange thing was that when you went down in the lift, you had to get out at the spa reception level so the staff could swipe their card to allow you access further down to the pool level. Or you could get out and go down the 2 flights of stairs. Very strange. | Overall, our stay at the Corinthia was excellent. We like to try different hotels when we stay in London but we would consider staying here again as it's so nice with a great spa area. The only complaint we have is that my husband requested a surprise cake to be in our room as it was my birthday, and this was not done. (He even asked twice!) So that was a shame. It's the little touches that hotel staff do for you that make your stay more memorable.","Surrey, United Kingdom",8/18/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Surprised at ease of location,"I regularly travel to London, but I usually stay in the Central/Western parts of town. I was intrigued by the special packages that APEX was offering and decided to give East London a shot- and I was very happy with my decision. It was very easy to connect to the parts of the city I wanted to see via Tube and Bus. This a great hotel, just be warned that it is in a business focused part of the city and nothing around the hotel is open on the weekend. But Liverpool Street is one Tube stop away (or 10 minute walk) so it's really not too much of a bother.","Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",8/14/2013
The Lanesborough,5,Afternoon tea an absolute delight,"I recently visited for afternoon tea with a friend. From start to finish it was wonderful, I'm so glad we picked this one! | They have a great assortment of tea, and our sandwiches, pastries, and scones were all delectable by far the best food I've had in London. We opted for the champagne option but I think it would still feel celebratory without it. | Just make sure to tell them if you have dietary restrictions when you're ordering. My friend is allergic to some nuts and they were very nice about it, but it was awkward when they brought the tray out and had to take it back and bring a new one because she hadn't mentioned it. | You can book online which I really liked and there is a bag and coat check which is nice, especially on a rainy day. | It is a beautiful, delicious, and wonderful experience. I would recommend it to everyone.","New York City, New York",7/16/2016
"Bulgari Hotel, London",5,Unbelievable Spa,"I had a spa treatment here. The spa itself was out of this world, extremely luxurious and conducive to relaxing. The massage was the best I have had.

Apex London Wall Hotel,5,A fantastic find,"We stayed overnight at the Hotel after attending a wedding nearby. The room, a double deluxe, was superb with an amazing bathroom with seperate double shower. The room had no view, but lets not forget it is smack bang in the centre of the City of London. We were provided with tea, coffee and biscuits as well as free pringles and jelly beans!! Breakfast was included in our stay and was served at the table, My husband thinks you can tell the qaulity of a Hotel by its sausages and these were lovely!! | The Hotel was amzaingly quiet and I had one of the best nights sleep ever in a hotel, beacause of it's location I would imagine it is very quiet at weekends. And in a way this is what makes it so good, compared to West End Hotels it was surprisingly cheap and yet you are only two tube stops away from the West End, it is also much much quieter than other Hotels we have stayed in the west end. I would not hesitate to book this hotel again","Lichfied, Staffs",3/5/2010

Rhodes Hotel,3,Très moyen,"Nous avions réservé une chambre pour 3. Cette chambre était située tout en haut de lhôtel qui nest pas équipé dascenseur, donc tous les matins et tous les soirs nous avions droit à nos exercices de Stepp, laccès au dernier étage étant très étroit avec des marches trop petites et dangereuses. | La chambre était équipée dun grand lit et de deux lits une personne, cest-à-dire quil ne restait plus de place dans la chambre très exiguë. Concernant la salle de bains, étant donné que nous étions au quatrième étage, évidement il ny avait pas de pression aux robinets, et les pommeaux de douches étaient en plus colmatés par le calcaire. Si nous prenions une douche après 10 H, il fallait attendre leau chaude au moins 10 mn. | Un soir, le veilleur de nuit était absent, et nous avons été quelque uns à lattendre pendant 15 mn. Lorsquil est arrivé, pas un mot dexcuse, bien sûr ! | L'isolation est un point faible de cet hôtel, que ce soit les travaux, le ménage ou les voisins, vous êtes en direct et profitez de tous les bruits. | Point positif de cet hôtel, son emplacement dans un quartier central, donc bien desservi. | Nous avons payé 137,75 £ par nuit, un peu trop cher pour ce type dhôtel désuet.

Corinthia Hotel London,4,The Hotel is Not Special for a Five-Star Place. The nail Spa is the worst,"My husband and I stayed at the Corinthia for four nights at the beginning of May. The Corinthia provides about what one would expect from a five-star hotel in London; nothing that special. Good location. The restaurant on site was excellent, the food superb. The service was a bit cool, even for the British. I had room service one night and it was fast and delicious, as good as at the restaurant. | Unfortunately, I received the worst manicure I have ever gotten at their spa, and that is what I will always remember about the Corinthia. The polish was applied so sloppily that I had to remove it and re-polish the same day. Worse, she over-buffed my nails and they are still thin and breaking.

Newham Hotel,4,Great stay on a budget,This hotel is a great place to stay on budget. The rooms are clean and comfortable I wouldn't say spacious but I have no complaints. There are good transport links to the city with plenty of regular buses to Upton park. There are plenty of places to eat nearby and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",5/26/2018
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,FANTASTIC HOTEL AND PHENOMENAL STAFF....,"What an incredible experience! From the front manager, Inga to Jordan, the concierge who assisted us in all of our needs, our stay in London couldn't be better. I stayed here with my sister Kelsey and this is the best decision we made in our entire trip! All the staff were very accommodating but Inga took extra time to go out of her way to take care of us. Even the housekeeper kept the rooms very clean and assured we had plenty of toiletries. Jordan the concierge was probably the best CONCIERGE I've ever spoken to and I've stayed in many 5 star hotels. You can always count on him to give you all the assistance you need as a tourist.","Palos Verdes Estates, California",2/12/2017
The Rembrandt,4,"Great Hotel, Great Location","I stayed on business in May 2013. The rooms were small, but were perfect for a business stay and very normal size by London standards I guess. The hotel is in a great location for business in the City as well as for taking in the sights and sounds of London. There are many very good restaurants within walking distance as well. I will stay here again on my next visit to London.","Johannesburg, South Africa",5/14/2014
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Just marvellous,"Nous étions à Londres pour un week-end. Arrivé par London city Airport (très pratique, une heure et demi de moins que le train, porte à porte depuis Paris), notre taxi nous dépose devant le Corinthia. Déjà, l'emplacement est bien choisi. Au pied de Charing Cross, nous sommes au coeur de Londres, Trafalgar au bout de la rue ... Le hall est majestueux, très réussi, nous avons admiré l'immense lustre de Baccarat. L'hôtesse d'accueil est hyper pro, elle nous fait visité les différents lieux, nous indique où prendre le thé, le petit-déjeuner, etc ... et nous conduit à notre chambre. Là, nous avons vu quelques beaux endroits, mais celui-ci est à retenir : un petit corridor mène au dressing face à l'entrée, à droite, une magnifique salle de bain dallée de marbre chocolat, à gauche, la chambre avec deux portes fenêtres donnant sur un petit balcon ouvrant sur une jolie cour intérieure paysagée. Le lit est délicieusement confortable, les pommes à dispositions, la cafetière nespresso, la taille de la douche, la baignoire équipée d'un écran plat intégrée à la faïence murale font partis des mille détails raffinés de cet hôtel. Nous avons profité du spa en rentrant d'une longue journée de crapahut dans Londres (open house london oblige). Je navais jamais vu un jacuzzi de cette taille, une vraie piscine jacuzzi avec plusieurs stations : allongé sur des rouleaux métalliques pour un massage en douceur, dans un fauteuil sous la douche tropicale, assis dans le bain à remous ... le sauna est magnifique avec ses cloisons vitrées, la piscine est délicieusement éclairée et tamisée, on resterait des heures dans un endroit pareil. Le petit déjeuner fut à la hauteur du standing. Une très belle salle double hauteur à la manière d'un café viennois début de siècle, un service impeccable et des produits frais et de qualité ... fantastic indeed ? no, amazing !","Paris, France",9/28/2012
The Savoy,5,The Ultimate hotel in the World,"There are hotels ,there are 5 star hotels and there is the Savoy. | Then service is impecable,the rooms are divine and the breakfast | Is an unbeaten liveable experience, anywhere in the World. | I cannot wait to return",Portsmouth,3/23/2015
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Great hotel,Excellent service and great restaurant. Would come again. Loved the Italian wine selection. | Excellent well thought out menu with attentive staff. | Bathrooms in hotel a little small however very functional. Good location for local attractions and transport links to central London,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",3/29/2015
Rhodes Hotel,2,Good Location Hotel but.....,"The location of this hotel is good as this is near to the Paddington station and Hyde Park. I read there are a lot of peoples saying that the staff is friendly and this is true but not the landlord of the hotel. We find and observed he is friendly and talkative to the Western people but not to the other countries of peoples. He even doesn't say goodbye to us when we leave the hotel when we said to him. This hotel do not free offer the traditional Full English breakfast as the normal B&amp;B will do but you can pay 6 pounds to buy the full breakfast which you could easily find the same price but better quality of food in nearby bar or cafe. The fried eggs is free of charge but you have to ask and they don't tell you if you don't ask. This hotel is fourth floor height and don't stay in the higher floor as you are surprising find the water pressure is terrible weak and even no single drop of cold water come out from the tap in the Peak hour so you have to wait until the off peak hour before using the shower. My advice is to test the water before you put your shower cream on otherwise you have really big trouble. The toilet is newly refruished but the carpet in the room is old and dirty which is highly contradict to the toilet. Well, this is our true experience I share it here for the reference and your experience may be totally different to us. By the way, we find somebody smelly sock left on the side of the bed which don't know how long has been left there.","Bradford, United Kingdom",8/17/2013
Rhodes Hotel,4,Très bon accueil,Bon accueil réservé par le gérant de l'hotel aux clients. Des professionnels serviables et sympathiques. Une chambre au standing satisfaisant. Le petit-déjeuner gagnerait à s'améliorer mais l'ensemble conserve un rapport qualité-prix concluant. Je recommande,NA,9/21/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Lovely stay!,"I stayed here for two nights. Everything is great about this hotel. Very friendly reception staffs, stylish interior, beautiful room, great location. If you want to be near the river, must stay here. I loved it. will definitely go back to the Mondrian.","Seoul, South Korea",5/26/2016
The Rembrandt,4,The Rembrandt is a good choice in London,"My wife and I spent four nights in The Rembrandt during the month of September. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the nearest subway station, and is fairly close to Harrods and is directly across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum. Our room was decent size and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel offers free wifi, which in my opinion places it several notches above other more expensive hotels which often charge outrageous rates for wifi. The breakfast included with our room had a good selection of hot and cold food, with decent coffee. The hotel clientele appeared to be a good mix of European and North American guests, with no large tour groups. Overall, in a city where the US dollar does not go very far, The Rembrandt is a good choice, and we would return in the future.","San Diego, California",10/2/2011
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Beautiful Spa & Location :),"I am writing this review quiet late, we stayed here on the new years eve and it was every bit wonderful, this is so wonderfully located and so central, London eye and the Big beg is walking form here, everything is right around the corner, the service is great from the door man to the reception you are treated royally, we got special bands to stand in the Fireworks viewing zone and watch the majestic fireworks the whole area was closed to public, only the guests staying in the hotels inside the viewing area were allowed and these bands were the identification for the same. | The spa is most wonderful and expansive , its got everything you can think of, the water jets the sauna ,the pools and the resting areas in the spa are very beautifully set up. | The restaurants and the decoration during christmas is beautiful and the huge chandelier in the lobby is Iconic. | However there was no view from our room, we also stayed at shangri-la at the shard and the view from there was Incredible. | To conclude i will say, you should stay here if you want to stay central and close to the attractions and for there fabulous service.Do not miss the spa.","Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",9/21/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,The Corinthia Hotels Bassoon Bar.,"Perfect for early evening meetings before it gets busy, the Bassoon Bar in the Corinthia Hotel offers Art Deco style with smooth service. The barman was accomplished, nothing was too much trouble and the nibbles that accompanied the perfect dry martinis were delicious. All in all a real find and a delightfully cool haven away from Trafalgar Square and the Embankment.","London, United Kingdom",10/28/2014
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",4,New and clean,"We stayed for I night quite expensive £300 which excluded breakfast. Hotel is quite new so the interior is very clean. Our room was quite small, and we were unable to get any fresh air as the window/door was locked . Location is good for Harrods etc,","Reading, United Kingdom",4/26/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Another fantastic visit to the Mondrian!,"I had such a wonderful experience staying at the Mondrian for my best friends 40th bday in November that I was keen for my husband to see what all the fuss was about, it didn't disappoint and the Mondrian is certainly our new favourite London hotel. | This was our first night away together without the children since our second son was born (he's now two), it's quite rare to find the time (and babysitters!) to do this sort of thing, and we couldn't believe how brilliant they made it for us! | From the moment we arrived, we were treated so well by the 'check in' staff and were thrilled to have a room upgrade with such an amazing view of the Thames and city. Another lovely surprise was to find a 'welcome back' note and a plate of beautiful macaroons in our room from Luke, touches like this really make a difference. | After a trip out for dinner we were lucky to catch up with Bernardo (asst front office manager) who asked us of our plans for the rest of the evening, having not thought past dinner and nothing planned he kindly arranged for us to go up to the Rumpus bar for drinks. Again, the staff were attentive and professional whilst producing fabulous cocktails!! The DJ was superb and the the atmosphere was great! It was a brilliant and unexpected end to our evening. | We slept so well and really appreciated an extended 'check out time' past 12pm. The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are wonderfully designed, I love all the Tom Dixon touches and the attention to detail. | Another reason to visit this hotel is the excellent location on the Southbank, so much to see and do on the doorstep and just a short walk from Waterloo station. | Service like this can be hard to find, If you are thinking about visiting this hotel, you simply MUST! My only regret is that I didn't have time to visit the fabulous Frederic in the Agua spa, I will certainly be back! | Thank you to everyone at the Mondrian, especially Bernardo and Luke for making us feel so comfortable and a much needed 'child free' night away so special!",London,2/17/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Good Stay,"The room is very clean and tidy. I stay there for 4nights and the staff will come in to refill everything like change the towel, tidy the bed, refill the beverage and bathroom set. | The room also very comfortable and the bed is pretty nice. I have a good sleep. | The location is closer to a lot of location by walking distance and it also close to train station |","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",10/23/2015
The Rembrandt,3,Average Hotel,"Stayed Saturday night. Staff friendly. We had a delux Room, but it did not really feel luxurious, not much for than one of the big chains. Had a night cap drink for two and at nearly £40 decided one was enough. It was clean and tidy, but will stay in one of the other more exclusive boutique hotels for about the same or slightly more. Breakfast was a buffet, it was very good though, with every choice of food. Showing was a bit hit and miss as the water kept going off.","Brighton, United Kingdom",10/4/2015
The Dorchester,5,Le top du Brunch à l'anglaise,"Pas besoin de séjourner dans l'hôtel de grand luxe réservé aux ""happy few"" pour profiter d'un brunch exceptionnel dans ""La Promenade"", un samedi à Londres. | Il faut en revanche absolument réserver. | Ce n'est pas bon marché, mais c'est vraiment, la quintessence du chic et du luxe britannique, tout est parfait : la décoration, le service, et bien entendu le fabuleux brunch (mon ""must"" : les ufs benedict). | Mesdames, profitez-en pour aller au toilettes, un véritable boudoir où parfums et crèmes pour les mains sont à votre disposition. Et vous passerez devant quelques vitrines aux ""babioles"" inaborbables, mais si belles ! | Avis valable aussi, bien sûr, pour le thé !","Paris, France",2/1/2012
Newham Hotel,2,Not great,"Not great. Dirty, poorly maintained, and judging by the breakfast some of the staff members blatantly dont care about looking after guests (mass-cooked fried eggs just left to sit for hours). One night receptionist (Tariq) was very helpful, though. Fine for a quick budget stay if you need to, but otherwise best avoided.",NA,8/19/2018
The Savoy,5,One word. Amazing!!!,"Stayed here for a corporate weekend. Wow what a treat, from the minute the taxi pulled up I was treated like a VIP. The concierge were attentive and knowledgeable. The decor amazing even down to the fresh flowers that were changed everyday. This hotel definitely has the wow factor and luxury down to a fine art. Food was amazing, I Have no idea how they cater for 80+ people to such a high standard. | Even if you cannot afford to stay here go in and try the cocktails in the American bar. An amazing memory.",NA,12/9/2013
The Savoy,4,Room not good enough,Two night stay including one night for a function. | Good points : public areas superb. Service exemplary. Breakfast amazing. Function food and service as good as it gets. | Bad points: room overlooking Thames well equipped but very tired Bathroom awful. Stained floor round loo. See picture attached. Walls filled but not painted in areas. Shower awful. Paper thin walls. If next door had a shower it was like a jumbo jet taking off. You could hear phone calls. Simply not acceptable in a room over £400 per night. Prices eye watering. £25 for a club sandwich ! | If the rooms were of same standard as rest of hotel 5 star plus. Truth is other hotels have similar level of service with much better rooms. A shame.,London,12/5/2015
The Rembrandt,4,Un hotel cómodo y bien ubicado,"Es un hotel bueno, en un barrio excelente, donde hay donde comer, museos y muy buena movilización | El hotel es normal pero las almohadas muy duras | Los consierge que hablaban español muy amables.","Santiago, Chile",6/19/2012
"Bulgari Hotel, London",5,An Amazing Hotel,"Stayed for a brief visit in a Studio Suite, they are quite lovely. Everything is perfect, would highly recommend, greatest location, quite, just right. The Spa and Pool are amazing, unusual and certainly a welcome respite. Would return for sure.","New York City, New York",9/7/2016
The Savoy,5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!,"I was bought a night stay at the Savoy with my wife for my 70th birthday and an afternoon tea voucher for the following day. Our trip absolutely exceeded all my expectations. It was perfect. We were upgraded when they found out it was my birthday and nothing was too much hassle. Our upgraded suite provided us with superb views of the Thames and I cannot think of a better way to end my birthday celebrations. We were greeted with a personal letter and a birthday cake all of which was arranged by the hotel. It was perfect. Thank you very much for a trip I will never forget. All staff, from the doorman to the receptionists and waiters were friendly and obliging. Nothing was too much trouble for anyone. Thank you","Southampton, United Kingdom",10/23/2016

Rhodes Hotel,5,Trevligt och prisvärt!,"Rummet var ganska litet, rent, bra städning, bekväma sängar. Nyrenoverat fräscht badrum, om än litet. Vänlig personal. Bra läge nära tåg, tunnelbana, bussar, gott om pubar och restauranger i området. Hyde Park runt hörnet. Frukost som ingick i priset var helt ok.","Stockholm, Sweden",5/17/2017
The Rembrandt,4,Muito bom,"Hospedei-me no ""THE REMBRAND"" entre 22 e 24 de junho de 2015 e gostei muito do hotel. O prédio é antigo mas totalmente reformado e em excelentes condições. Localização excelente para os fãs dos museus (também fica bem perto da Harrods para quem ama compras). O único ponto que poderia ser melhorado é o controle do ar-condicionado, que é fixo na parede e não permite muitos ajustes, ou gelando demais ou esquentando demais. Também acho que para os hóspedes não deveria haver taxa extra para a utilização da piscina, da academia e da sauna (na verdade é um SPA ao lado que presta os serviços para os hóspedes, mediante taxa de 7,5 libras). No mais, trata-se de um hotel EXCELENTE.","Sao Paulo, SP",6/26/2015
Ridgemount Hotel,4,Pleasant staff and a great location,"Just returned from London where I stayed 5 days at the Ridgemount Hotel. The room was a little small and the bed quite narrow but as others have said, everything was very clean especially the shared shower and toilet, the breakfast was good and the owners quite friendly. It's not luxurious but it was functional, the price was very reasonable and the location can't be beat. I would certainly consider staying here again on my next trip to London.","Campbell, CA",9/13/2011
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",3,"Bello allapparenza, ma colazione tristissima","Quando entri nella hall è moto carino e lo staff è gentilissimo | Atmosfera cool e raffinata, un bel posto | Spesso in reception ci sono simpaticissimi ragazzi italiani e ti senti subito accolto! | Camere belle e nuove...peccato per la MOQUETTE che trovo molto english ma old style e personalmente non tollero (non nel 2018 dai!!!!) | Tutto bene benissimo tranne la COLAZIONE...scarsa, povera e se osi ordinare qualcosa dal menù lo paghi caro | Ho preso dei pancakes per 9£ e mi sono arrivati due orribili sottilissimi pancakes che somigliavano più a crepes...un piatto brutto da vedere e piccolissimo, mega delusione!!!!!! | Forse ci torneró, ma a queste cifre cè di meglio","Milan, Italy",8/29/2018
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Best hotel and quiet area,I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. I picked it because it was in a quiet area and very close to three different tube stops. The hotel is modern and very tastefully decorated. Our room was large and clean and comfortable. We had every amenity you could want. They surprised us with champagne and a handwritten note to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. They helped us over and over again with directions and restaurant suggestions. I would stay in this hotel again in a heart beat.,Mississippi,10/6/2013
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",4,Nice location,"The hotel is in a great location - minutes from Harrods and within walking distance to Fortum &amp; Mason and other shopping and sightseeing areas. Our room was nice. I loved the long tub and the heated towel rack. It wasn't a Four Seasons, but it was pretty nice. We got a non-smoking room, but apparently not a non-smoking floor. We had to put towels on the bottom of the doorway to keep the smell of smoke out since it triggers my migraines and my husband's allergies, and the walls were pretty thin so you can hear kids wailing and phones ringing in other rooms. The view from our room sucked - we just got to look out into another room and concrete building - no Hyde Park or view of the city. The staff was hit and miss. I don't think they really went out of their way to service us, but they weren't blatantly rude either. Not a big deal, but we opened the door ourselves several times. Don't know where the doorman went, but it would have been helpful with our luggage and packages from shopping. I will say the room service was great - their staff was always super nice as was the housekeeping staff. We will probably stay again because overall it was a nice experience.",Oklahoma,11/30/2004
The Rembrandt,5,"Great hotel, wonderful location","My husband and I recently stayed at The Rembrandt for a few nights. It was a great choice. The room was very comfortable and quiet, and spacious enough for the two of us. The breakfast (included) included a variety of choices, and was very good. To me, this is the best neighborhood for a stay in London. We will definitely return.","Shelburne, Vermont",6/19/2017
The Savoy,5,Beautiful Classy and freindly,Stunning environment full of history and class with guests made to feel part of it by friendly and attentive staff. | The room was amazingly quiet and the bed one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. | My wife and I went for our Silver Wedding Anniversary and had a magical time,"Princes Risborough, United Kingdom",12/17/2014
The Savoy,5,The American Bar - Art Deco elegance,"I'm an American so when visiting friends in London, I had to visit American Bar at the lovely Savoy. | It didn't disappoint. I read in an earlier review that the dress code had been less strict, but on my visit most of the guests appeared to be nicely dressed or at least 'put together', which I think is important in hotels such as the Savoy. I don't particularly want to look at sloppy tourists in flip flops and grubby clothes. | My favorite aspect of this bar was that I felt like I was on the set of an Astaire/Rogers movie. Absolutely beautiful contemporary Art Deco! Fred and Ginger were even on the walls, which made me very happy as I am a huge Ginger Rogers fan. They even showed me a book that named all of the celebrities whose portraits were on the walls of the bar. They had Ginger Rogers incorrectly labeled as Zsa Zsa Gabor, which I hope will be corrected. Other than than that, I had no complaints. | The prices were...pricey (over £40 for 2 gin and tonics), but the service was excellent and I don't mind paying more for a great experience, which this was. I've stayed at and visited several historic, legendary hotels such as the Waldorf Astoria in NYC, the Hollywood Roosevelt in LA, and the Fairmont in SFO. Now I'm happy to add the Savoy in London to the list! As I said earlier, I was not disappointed.","Palm Desert, California",11/25/2016
The Savoy,5,Amazing stay cant wait to go back!,"Stayed here with my boyfriend &amp; cannot wait to come back the next time Im in London... everything is fabulous the food, staff &amp; hotel all amazing, our suite was stunning over looking the Thames &amp; I have never stayed in a more comfortable bed. Highly recommend this hotel.","Burbage, United Kingdom",7/15/2018
Rhodes Hotel,4,February stay at Rhodes.,"The location of the hotel is excellent with just a short walk to Paddington and Lancaster Gate. My single room was basic but clean. The breakfast was very good as well. The staff were all polite and helpful.

Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Wife's 30th birthday,"Fantastic hotel and staff were great. Check in quick and informative. The room was beautiful, clean and modern. I had pre ordered a birthday cake which was delicious. I love coffee and the nespresso machine was a nice touch. I was eyeing up those jelly beans and reading another review they said they were complimentary l, had I known they would have been eaten. So missed an opportunity. Couldn't have asked for much more. Would highly recommend.",Elloughton,4/12/2016
The Savoy,5,Afternoon tea,"We booked in for 'afternoon tea' at the very early time of 13:45, I am glad we had gone early as we could easily have spent all afternoon sipping tea, nibbling on fantastic sandwiches and pastries. Oh the pastries!!! SUPERB!! We really took our time (over 2 hours). Initially we were served by Rahoul who was polite and helpfull but perhaps not the swiftest by any means, Susanna who served us after we had been waiting for a refill of tea for some time, was brilliant and deserves a special mention, swift, kind, funny, ultra attentive, smiling and really made you feel special. The hotel needs people like her and to keep them. Management please take note, she saved this review from average service to AMAZING. | The Lychee Red tea was a delight (bought some to take home), scones were warm and light. Did i mention the pastries? It was worth it just for the pastries....the ham and mustard was finely judged and i would say perfect, we were maybe lucky with the service in the end. | We will be back..","Peterborough, United Kingdom",10/20/2012
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Sparkling Hotel and Impressive Service,"A short sightseeing weekend, the service from all staff members was warm and attentive. Lovely big room - we had a 'deluxe', felt it was a shame we could not stay longer to enjoy it! We included breakfast, which is 'a la carte' rather than buffet, and was substantial, meat, cheese, toast, full English. Hotel is very easy to reach from either Moorgate or Bank tube, buses from Bank take you to Strand within a few minutes, handy for Covent Garden/theatres. We would certainly stay again.",Rockville,7/19/2010
A To Z Hotel,3,OK hotel i forhold til prisen,"Hvis man vælger et hotel som dette, så skal man tjekke alting hjemmefra først. Ikke særlig gode muligheder for at kunne komme frem og tilbage om aftenen. Der er dog en overground station med tog rimelig tæt på, men det skal man tage til en yder station, og derfor underground indtil London. Busserne kører også 24/7 og skal man være i lufthavnen forholdsvis tidligt, så kan det være en stor udfordring at komme frem, da busruterne skal planlægges, men det kan så gøres på en internet side, som står på busskiltene - men der er intet internet på hotellet - jeg fangede noget fra en nabo, og stikkene er ikke som i Danmark, så der skal man købe en adapter fra Boots til 5 pund, eller have en med hjemmefra! | Sengene var okay, de var meget hårde, men ellers var vi udmærkede tilfredse med hotellet, da vi ikke opholdte os der særlig meget. | Så hvis man vælger et hotel som dette, skal man i hvert fald gide at bruge tid på transport frem og tilbage.","Risskov, Denmark",6/4/2013
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed here for one night to attend a seminar that was being held at the hotel. Simply from start to finish the whole experience was superb. We had lunch, dinner and breakfast at the hotel and they were excellent. My room was spacious and beautifully appointed, and the bathroom a drea. Best part is it was all free as a fear the cost of staying here is prohibitive for most.",Cumbria,10/8/2012

Corinthia Hotel London,5,Bond...James Bond,Thats how I felt upon entering this fine hotel... | I had heard about this hotel from someone who works in the film entertainment industry and has stayed at the best of the best hotels. He said it was a great hotel so I decided to check it out. | I loved this hotel. From the moment you arrive they greet you with top quality service. The hotel is very close to everything but on a side of the street that was quite in terms of street noise. My room was not ready when I checked in at 12 so they had me wait and served some tea and snacks. It was quickly made up and I was sent up with my bags waiting in the room and fresh fruit. The lobby is a beautiful place to sit and relax. The rooms are very well appointed and are designed with good taste. All the amenities and bathroom was first class. Ill be honest and say that I didnt want to leave but when it was time to go the service was impeccable. I had to get to the tube so I was personally escorted across to the station and shown how to operate the ticket machine. It was a quick visit but I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I wish i had another day to visit the gym and spa which looked amazing. I hope to stay there again soon!,"Oakland, California",8/19/2014

The Savoy,5,My favourite hotel - in the world,This is the 3rd time we have stayed at The Savoy. 1st time since its refurbishment and it is still wonderful. The service given is second to none. All staff so knowledgeable and helpful. Just wish we could stay more often. Stayed on their Sunday Best Rate - what good value. Wonderful room with a side-river view. Dinner in Kasper's and full English breakfast. Doesn't get much better than that. Well done The Savoy in making our stay so good.,"Angmering, United Kingdom",1/14/2014

Friends room was small but asked for another and were given an up grade for free. Everything you required was on room, I asked for an iron, it was at my door in minutes. Breakfast was fab, everything you require for a busy day ahead. But the main reason for my good review was the staff. Have never been to a hotel where ALL the staff were so once, really welcoming and warm. Special mention for the desk staff and the doorman (Sillas?) I will definitely be back.","Dundee, United Kingdom",8/3/2016
The Savoy,5,Outstanding stay for wedding,"I booked the Savoy for my daughter, parents and wife and I ahead of my daughter's wedding in London. The welcome and service received was second to none...with requests handled speedily and courteously. The rooms were comfortable and well equipped, and particularly quiet for a London hotel (having stayed in many over the years). The food was excellent, whether tea, dinner or breakfast, and again service was friendly and of the best standards. Special mention to the concierge and door staff who handled the wedding departure arrangements with great humour and friendliness. The Savoy certainly goes that extra mile that makes all the difference.","Llandudno, United Kingdom",12/30/2014
The Savoy,5,Birthday afternoon tea,"Having previously stayed here, but were unable to have the afternoon tea (as fully booked), we pre-booked this a few months in advance. What a lovely treat it was! You are made to feel very special by the staff from start to finish. We had sandwiches, smoked salmon and scambled eggs, cakes, tea and champagne. I was even sung Happy Birthday by the pianist and a small birthday cake was brought over to me. Overall a fabulous experience.",NA,12/8/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Wow the Mondrian !!!,We stayed at Mondrian for 4 days and we used all the facilities of the hotel. Expecially thanks to Giacomo at breakfast that Washington very attentive and Aries that organised all our trip from the transpirtation to all pur day in london . She booked us at restaurant and clubs !!! We will ne back !,NA,2/2/2018
Ridgemount Hotel,4,Terrific value; try to get renovated room,"I stayed here by myself in one of the single rooms with a shared bath in early January. I was very impressed! You can tell right away that it is a family run business and that all employees of the hotel take great pride in their work. Very nice people; very clean rooms -- and a terrific breakfast, just like a restaurant!! Really, I looked hard to find the best deals in London, and I think this is probably the best deal that you'll be able to find -- especially in such a great location; you are very central and can walk all over the West End. | I actually stayed here twice. The first time, I was given a room downstairs. That room wasn't quite renovated and the shower wasn't the greatest. The second time, I was given a room on the very top floor. The room was much more renovated and the bathroom was much better. I'd recommend to try to get a room on the top floor if possible. In both cases, the beds seemed a tad old and used, but nothing major and certainly for the price I'm not complaining. | Again, great hotel -- would definitely stay here again in London, especially if I'm on a budget!","Boulder, Colorado",2/10/2012
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Outstanding Location and Service,"My husband and I stayed here in December for a Christmas getaway, we wanted to experience some cold weather (its warm where we live) and Christmas cheer, which London is full of! We picked the Corinthia based on reviews and what appeared to be a good location, and we are so happy we did. | The location can't be beat. We could walk practically everywhere, and the embankment tube is a very convenient line, we could go most places we wanted to go without transfer. We really didn't need to cab at all. This hotel is walking distance to Westminster Abbey, Parliament, Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, St. Paul's Cathedral, the Churchill War Rooms, most of the popular Theatres, Trafalgar Square, Sommerset House, tons of parks and museums, it was a bit far but we also had a nice walk to Harrods and the wonderful high end shopping over on Sloane street and Knightsbridge area. | The service at the hotel was outstanding all around. Breakfast was delivered every morning on time to our room with professionalism and a smile. I had many requests that the concierge happily fulfilled prior to our arrival including obtaining some very hard to get theater tickets, and multiple dinner reservations. Max and other concierge staff, thank you for all your help! The doormen were attentive, I never had to open the door, they always were there to greet us. And housekeeping was also very good. I appreciate the washcloth under makeup compacts and other toiletries, extra items of what was clearly being used the most, organization of the countertop, a clean pair of slippers each night, etc. I also want to add that they have excellent hairdryers, BaByliss Pro Hairdryers, so I didn't have to fry my fine hair with a standard hotel hairdryer. | The room and bathroom were a nice size, I thought they were larger by European hotel standards. | Lastly, if you stay here you MUST do the champagne tea. It was such a wonderful experience, I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting London, they must go here for tea. I wish we had time to do it more than once. | Overall we had a wonderful trip and this hotel was a big part of it, so thank you to all the staff.",U.S.,12/26/2013
The Rembrandt,4,A very pleasant discovery!,"We used the HR as a pit stop on our trip to Italy so we stayed their twice in a month's time. In both cases we received no-charge room upgrades from the young but eager desk staff (I think it probably helps we weren't traveling with the ""package tour"" groups). | This Knightsbridge property is very conveniently located across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum and Natural History Museum (both with free admission). It's about a 10-minute walk from Harrod's as well as the South Kensington tube station. During our visit a fair amount of nearby sidewalk and road was torn up for an extensive gas line refurbishing but this didn't affect our ability to get anywhere (just made life tough for taxi drivers). | As mentioned above desk staff are young and multi-lingual. Concierge staff are helpful but not entirely knowledgable of what's available locally (ie. restaurants). A great concierge doesn't need to consult a computer to know what restaurants are nearby, etc. | The only knock on the property is that their web site (and on-site promotions) market a swimming pool/spa area which, as an American accustomed to this sort of property, one infers is free to hotel guests. The pool is actually part of a separate business and it costs GBP 7.50 just to take a plunge or sit in the hot tub. Given the hotel tariff that seemed a bit mean. | The lounge/bar area is substantial and service good. The restaurant puts on a very substantial breakfast (like: WOW!) but wasn't open for dinner service (it seemed to me the hotel was curtailing its hours). | Check-in/Check-out were a breeze and the concierge staff were a great help in finding alternative transportation to Heathrow.",Seattle,9/27/2011
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Lives up to it's name!,"We stayed for four nights in this hotel, and had a wonderful experience. Although the rooms were small, they were exactly what we wanted, with everything you could possibly need in it. The bathroom was modern, and the expensive toiletries were a lovely touch. Also, it may seem trivial to some, but unlike most other hotels I've stayed in, the hairdryer was of excellent quality and the wifi was fast and reliable. | Breakfasts were consistently nice, with a varied choice of items. Every staff member we encountered was exceptionally helpful and friendly. | The hotel is also nearby to bus and tube stations, so you're never out of reach. Overall, I enjoyed my stay here very much!","Durham, United Kingdom",8/4/2015
The Rembrandt,4,Perfect London location,"Perfect location, very safe area and staff is most helpful for info, taxis, etc. Directly across from the Victoria and Albert Museum, and directly up the street from Harrod's, Starbucks, etc. The bus tour stops directly across the street as well. Three or four blocks away is the tube stop. Breakfast was included in our reservations, but had it delivered to our room every morning for just a small extra charge and it was excellent and beautifully served. I have stayed in various locations in London on many trips and The Rembrandt, by far, is the best.","Linville Falls, North Carolina",10/14/2011
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Hotel fit for a King,"I'm not as eloquent as some of the reviewers on here, but I shall try and do the hotel justice. | I stayed here on 5th/6th November with my girlfriend, using it only as a base and somewhere to stay. I chose it because of the reviews on here, and the price. | It wasn't the easiest place to get to using the tube (we arrived at Euston), and maybe I'll bear that in mind next time I'm booking a hotel in London, but when we got there we couldn't have had a more friendly, and warm welcome. The staff were thoroughly excellent. Despite us having probably the cheapest room they do (I overheard someone organising 3 taxis for someone's luggage!!!), they treated us with upmost courtesy, and I felt very valued. | When we got to the room, as others have said, it was bijou. It was also a twin, which was a disappointment. But the room itself was spotless. As we were only showering (there was a bath too) and sleeping there it wasn't a problem, but a longer trip may have needed a bit more room. | The beds were lovely and comfortable, the in room entertainment was excellent, Bluetooth radio/speaker, TV and tablet. I thought the tablet could have been enhanced by having a music/streaming radio app to let you listen to music whilst enjoying a bath. | In short, this is a wonderful hotel. If you want the experience of a top hotel, with excellent customer service, then stay here. If your budget allows, you could pay for a room to match the experience, mine budget didn't, but what I had was excellent nonetheless. | Thank you to all the staff for your excellent work, it made us feel valued, and gave us a brilliant experience. To the management, keep doing what you're doing. However if you want to upgrade me to a suite next time then I wouldn't say no :-)",NA,11/10/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,A very enjoyable stay!,"My wife and I spent two days at the Mondrian Sea Containers and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This hotel is great value given that it is centally located right on the South Bank. It was my wifes birthday and Luke (the guest experience manager) surprised us with a complimentary bottle of wine!! All the staff were attentitive and friendly, Zachary checked us in and was very efficient/helpful","Chelmsford, United Kingdom",4/20/2015
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Per soggiornare a Londra senza svenarsi,"Hotel adorabile (tipicamente British nell'arredamento, tutto in legno rustico e moquette, piccolo e con scale strette), ottimamente posizionato (a due passi dalla fermata Euston Square della metropolitana, e a Londra una volta che hai una fermata di metro vicino arrivi ovunque), prezzi estremamente favorevoli e offrediverse scelte di sistemazione a seconda del budget: si può optare per avere il bagno in camera oppure di prendere una stanza senza bagno e usare quello comune al piano in fondo al corridoio. La colazione è abbondantissima, sia continentale che British: si può optare per pomodori, uova, fagioli e bacon così come latte, caffè, cioccolata e cereali di ogni tipo. Il personale è carinissimo e gentile, e hanno anche la lavanderia! Si possono lasciare i panni al mattino e li si trova lavati e asciugati la sera. Ideale per soggiornare a Londra senza doversi salassare, e nonostante il prezzo ridotto non mancava in nulla di fondamentale: pulizia impeccabile e, come appena detto, moltissimi servizi. Se dovessi tornare a Londra andrò sicuramente lì! Io personalmente sono venuta a conoscenza di questo hotel trovandolo elencato sulla guida di Londra della Lonely Planet, quindi se lo consigliano loro c'è da fidarsi. E' più che ovvio che non stiamo parlando dell'Hilton o del Plaza o del Best Crown, ed è anche chiaro che quando si viaggia bisogna anche un po' adattarsi a situazioni spartane o comunque diverse da casa propria, ma se manca questo presupposto è del tutto inutile viaggiare e poi mettere recensioni negative dei luoghi.","Milan, Italy",3/10/2014
The Dorchester,5,First class,"I stayed at the Dorchester for one night only for the purpose of a special occasion. This is a world class hotel located in an exclusive part of central London. The small amount of reserved parking spaces in front of the hotel are only ever full with Ferraris, Aston Martins, and Bentleys etc. | On arrival, the lady at reception was 100% welcoming, polite and professional. | Room was luxurious, spacious and perfect. | On a separate occasion in 2007 I had dinner at the Dorchester and again the service and quality was 100% at all times. | This hotel will not come cheap, but for a special occasion/treat, you should certainly not be disappointed.","Watford, United Kingdom",7/12/2009
The Savoy,1,Horrible service at The Savoy,We were locked out of our room twice in a 3 day stay due to the Savoy not being able to track our reservation - the excuses included that we were responsible until they finally admitted their system is fouled up,"Toronto, Canada",7/17/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,The most wonderful dining experience in London,We had the most delightful and wonderful evening at the Sea Container. The service was superb (ask for Teresa) and the food was outstanding. The Dover Sole (from Dover) with a French caper sauce was a work of art.,"Henderson, Nevada",1/4/2017
The Savoy,5,"Excellent location, superior service and old world class","From the moment you step in you are welcomed into another world - an era bygone... And that feeling is maintained through every part of this hotel experience. Checkin is in a salon inside where the person checking you in sitting across you and there is a beautifully appointed desk in between. Checkin in quick and the even exchange of credit card and room keys is done in a discreet way. | The hotel is vast and spread out - learn your elevator colors - critical that you choose the right one - there are several ""lost"" people walking around at all times - the helpful staff always is always willing to walk you to the right elevator. Not sure why this is like this - but thinks it adds to the hotel's charm. | Rooms are large, decorated in a classic style, bedroom on one side and the bathroom on the other. Bathroom was large with both bathtub and shower. There was both cleaning service and turn down service and it seemed that every time i stepped out of the room someone had come and cleaned it. | Restaurant is a definite must do - though i had dinner there only one night among the four nights i stayed there. Great ambience and great service. | The gym and pool are both tiny - however there was no one using either facilities - on all the four days i stayed there it seemed that i was the only person using the gym or pool. | Very centrally located - both for business and leisure. | A truly old world London experience.",NA,8/16/2015
The Lanesborough,5,Service de haute voltige !,"Nous avons séjourné en famille pour 4 nuits , la 2eme nuit nous avons rencontré un problème d'odeurs lié à la climatisation et après en avoir informé le majordome nous avons obtenu un changement de chambre dans les 30 minutes ! | Le transfert des effets personnels effectué | par le majordome ... | Et tout cela avec un grand professionnalisme sous le contrôle du manager principal ( un femme blonde charmante !) | Le tea time au restaurant Le Céleste est fantastique ( bravo à Camille pour son attention ) | Habitué de la chaîne Four Seasons , le niveau de service de cet hotel est même | un cran au-dessus !! | Bravo.","Aix-en-Provence, France",10/29/2016
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",4,Good... but lacked that something special,"Stayed one night for a romantic weekend away. The hotel is spotlessly clean, staff are very helpful and attentive, all the services you might require are available but for us it just lacked that little extra something special that would make it stand out from the crowd. It didn't feel as memorable as we'd hoped. Having said that I can't fault the hotel or the staff as they were both excellent, but we didn't come away raving about it as we have done with other hotels and for the money, I was just slightly disappointed. Maybe my expectations are just too high?","Crowborough, United Kingdom",10/18/2016
The Rembrandt,5,"Great location, lovely service !","We stayed here on the way back from a trip to Bruges. This was a secret escapes booking and we hadnt realised it included a glass of fizz and a share board, it was really lovely food and much appreciated after our journey. We werent here long really but I did enjoy it.","Hartlepool, United Kingdom",5/21/2018
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",4,Cute hotel in Kensington,The classical look is everything. I loved especially the lounge for breakfast that you will be sitting and watching the passers by walk along the Cromwell road. | Closest tube station is Earls Court and Gloucester Road. Kensington Park is a delight to take a long stroll. Shopping at Knightsbridge is fun. And museums are also some walking distance. Recommended for people looking for cozy stay.,Japan,5/20/2018
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,One night stay to celebrate my 40th,Great stay- brilliant location- reception staff very good- our guy wore a suit- the others had a jumper/sweater style top on- it was hot outside and I think their outfit could look better in the summer. Given a nice room - would have loved a view of the thames etc but guess you have to pay more for that? We were left a bottle of wine to start off our celebrations and this was a very nice touch and much appreciated. | Rumpus room great place- make a reservation for the evening though as very popular- dress up.... - one guy tried to get in wearing flip flops? really? I've written a separate review regarding the Rumpus room- great views- gorgeous cocktails which deserve the price tag. | Breakfast was included at the hotel but service here not very good I'm afraid- food was very nice though- one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had- sausage very nice- mushrooms etc- no beans though? | Re service- the lady at front of house showed us to a seat and swiftly went- even at the premier inn they take a minute to explain whats on offer- no one offered us tea of coffee we had to get a waitress attention- there were no sauces on the table I had to get up and ask- so service not very good at breakfast- and it wasn't even that busy. | All in all though a great place to stay- stylish and modern -,"Bristol, United Kingdom",7/6/2015
The Dorchester,5,Ottimo,"Hotel di alto livello, personale attento e professionale,internet gratuito, colazione ottima, camere perfette....il migliore te all'inglese di Londra, un vero trionfo di tramezzini, dolci e pasticcini.assolutamente da non mancare .Un vero peccato dover partire...","Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland",1/17/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Perfect in every way!,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Mondrian and could not rate it highly enough. It was so good, we spent the entire time in the hotel! Cocktails in the Rumpus Room, a sumptuous seafood platter in the beautiful restaurant and more cocktails in the Dandelyan Bar. Our room was beautifully appointed and we loved the special touches - truffles and macarons on arrival and candles lit at turn down time. Thanks for having us, we'll definitely be back!","Hook, United Kingdom",12/14/2015
The Rembrandt,2,Caution - Musty and shabby.,"Caution - Our room was musty, shabby, and hot - certainly not ""four star"" quality. Service was fine, but not exceptional. Perhaps you need the ""upgrade"" in order to get the quality that everyone else is talking about in their reviews. The location was very convenient. (7/2003)","San Francisco, CA",7/14/2003
The Dorchester,5,perfection!!,"I am just back from an amazing 2 night stay in the Dorchester Hotel with my family. From the moment we got there until the moment we left we were treated with impeccable 5 star service. We were particularly happy with the service from one of their employees, Arnau, who looked after us and our every need in the most professional and friendly manner possible and really made our stay that little bit more special. The breakfast was beautiful and had so much variety and on one of the mornings that we ordered breakfast in bed it was delivered fast and efficiently and was still piping hot...nothing better to wake up to. i cant wait to return to London and I without a doubt know where I will be booking myself into.","Dublin, Ireland",9/7/2011
The Rembrandt,5,Excellent hotel in a fantastic location for the museums!,"We booked this hotel mainly for its location and reputation and it didn't disappoint! It is literally across the road from the V&amp;A. Check in was quick, simple and friendly. The room was spotless and very well appointed. Our only very small criticism was the breakfast which was busy and some of the components were a little below expectations.","Mirfield, United Kingdom",9/21/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Morgan Hotels does it again!,"I had an expectation before I arrived because I have stayed in nearly all the Morgan Hotels here and in the States. | This delivered and kept on delivering! In my opinion it is the best in the group. | From the moment my wife and I arrived we were made to feel very special. Reception upgraded us to a River view and the views of St Paul's and the river bank are spectacular. | There was a bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room upon arrival from Luke at Guest Relations so a very big thank you to Luke for looking after us so well. | You can tell the hotel is new and only opened in September because it still smells brand new and everything feels in perfect condition. The rooms are spotless and have all the usual amenities but small details which usually annoy me in hotels are accommodated here like ample plug sockets and located by the beds. The room was a very good size for London and were decorated to a high spec. | In the early evening we visited Rumpus bar on the top floor which has amazing views and even better cocktails! It had a pretty cool buzz going on too. Then we visited the Sea Container bar downstairs and enjoyed two excellent Bloody Mary's. | My wife and I have been fortunate enough to stay in lots of 5 star hotels and they are usually let down by the pretentious cold attitude of the staff that make you privileged to stay there. Here you are made to feel like a VIP from check-in to departure. | We enjoyed it that much we are going to return in a few weeks - it will be our only ""go-to"" hotel in London from now on so please don't let us down guys...we expect that service every time we visit as you have just raised the bar!","Liverpool, United Kingdom",12/14/2014
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Great little Hotel!,"We only stayed for one night as we were visiting the V&amp;A, which was a shame but right from the off we were really impressed. | The style of the hotel was great as was the Staff, very friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but this didn't bother us at all. The room was very clean and modern with a surprise terrace! | The only negative was the prices in the cocktail bar, you expect to pay more in a hotel but be warned they are very expensive even by London standards! Overall I would definitely stay here again just wouldn't use the bar.",West Midlands,7/29/2013
The Savoy,4,Lunch by the River,"A fabulous return to the Savoy. We spent three hours over lunch, never felt rushed by the attentive staff. Advice on wines was subtle and appropriate topped off by a wonderful recommendation for a 'port' to compliment our cheese. | Not cheap but well worth the expense as a treat.","Peterborough, United Kingdom",2/5/2012
The Savoy,5,A real treat!,"We booked a 'pudding and cocktail' as a special treat during a weekend stay in the city. | Have stayed in many hotels all over the world but this one is in a league of its own. | The hotel is stunning, the staff are excellent and service, unsurprisingly was superb. | We went into the American bar for a glass of champagne and the ambience in there was very relaxing. | Will hopefully return one day to stay overnight. | A wonderful experience.","Shrewsbury, United Kingdom",6/20/2016
Rhodes Hotel,4,Lovely but wish AC worked,"Stayed for 3 nights after a long mission trip to Ghana. Was looking forward to air conditioning and a hot shower. The hotel is located close to major transportation and lots of dining options and convenience stores close by. Also super close to Hyde Park and great shopping. The room itself was adorable - very small but good use of space and decorated very nicely, The showers were hot, and the bathrooms were tiny but functional. The staff was very courteous, and the complimentary breakfast was nice. The downside to my stay was that my bed was lop-sided and not comfortable (my room-mates bed was fine and very comfy). And the AC would not stay on! I don't know if we are just air-headed Americans that could not figure out how to work the thermostat but we did call the office to complain. They got it working but it would not stay on to cool the room. Had to open windows. If not for these 2 issues (the bed and AC) I would have rated 5 stars.","Port Charlotte, Florida",8/5/2013
Corinthia Hotel London,2,Disappointed in room,"Very disappointed in the room (executive room, streetview) - which was small in size and cleanliness can be improved. Room decor is a little old. Different from photo shown on website ( missing fireplace, and mirror/clock on wall ) Pricey and i get a far better suite at Rosewood with lower price yet excellent service overthere.",Surrey,5/31/2015
Apex London Wall Hotel,2,Why add service charge?,"Stopped in here a few times, only just found out that each time I have been going to the bar myself and carried my own drinks back to the table I have been charged 12.5% for the privilege!! How can this be justified? I think it is pretty terrible and is a worrying trend to rip people off!",London,11/4/2014

Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Nice surprise for a London hotel!,"I was traveling with my daughters, so booked two rooms everywhere we went on our trip. We arrived before check-in, so the hotel held our bags and put them in our rooms once they were available, and were thoughtful enough to put the bags for the girls in the room with the biggest bathroom (they explained that they made that choice, and I certainly couldn't argue with the logic.) The financial district is pretty dead on the weekend but, as another post pointed out, it's an easy walk to a few Underground stations. I found the free bottled water, free WiFi, large rooms, nice toiletries and very friendly staff to be a welcomed change of pace compared with some other London hotels I've used and, considering the price, a great value. Next time I'm in London, this will definitely be my hotel.","Houston, Texas",6/25/2012
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Excellent 4 day stay,"Great, clean, helpful hotel in Kensington. The hotel room was smaller than a US hotel, but suited us just fine.

The Savoy,4,An English experience,"Excellent hotel if you get the right room ( I was upgraded to personality suit) ... Beautiful lobby, nice restaurants, friendly staff, overall nice place to stay if you are on holiday as it is close to theaters and tourist attractions in London ... To get to Kensington or knightsbridge from the Savoy will take good 20 minutes by taxi ... To airport 60 minute and will cost you 90 pounds","Muscat, Oman",6/25/2013
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Perfect business trip stay!,"A seamless stay from start to finish! Skilled staff, great decoration, spacious and comprehensive rooms with little touches that make the hotel memorable (little ducks in the shower, jelly beans etc.). All very clean and tidy as well! Restaurant and bar also good. Good location for early morning travel and also near the office of my client! Will definitely recommend my colleagues to stay here whenever they visit London.","Hamburg, Germany",12/19/2012
The Savoy,5,Great for a late night drink!,We enjoy having a late night bottle of Chablis in the piano bar at The Savoy!

The Savoy,5,Special experience,"Our recent stay at The Savoy in London was truly memorable. It is a really special place and the staff are totally amazing. They are most helpful &amp; genuinely friendly. No request or query is too much trouble. The rooms are beautifully decorated and furnished although don't expect a view. If you have trouble climbing in to a very deep bath, make sure you request a room with a separate shower. | It is a great location, very near to most of the theatres, a short walk to Charring Cross Station &amp; Trafalgar Square &amp; quiet close to the parliament buildings in the opposite direction.",NA,8/5/2016

Corinthia Hotel London,5,Breakfast at the Northall Resataurant - a real treat in every way!,"Our breakfast here was part of a birthday treat for my daughter. I chose the Northall as it specialises in Fresh Seasonal British produce. A real treat for us both, it was close to Christmas so on entering the hotel the lobby was beautifully decorated. | The restaurant is very elegant and breathtaking with plush burnt orange leather complimented by glittering mirrored panels, large picture windows allowing lots of natural light, a large island bar with wonderful chandaliers. | We ate of the a la carte menu, there is also a buffet menu. I chose Loch Var Smoked Salmon with Organic Scrambled Eggs on a Toasted Brioche £16 and my daughter had Toasted English Muffin with Middle Dry Cure Bacon and Poached Organic Egg £15, worth every penny. | The staff were very attentive, professional and friendly, we weren't rushed, we ate around 10.30 so I guess we had missed the early rush. It is a very calm and relaxing environment. | Wonderful!","Manchester, United Kingdom",2/14/2015

(oeufs, bacon, céréales, lait, café, jus d'orange) | L'emplacement est bien, une dizaine de minutes pour aller à pied à Soho. | Si vous ne voulez pas consacrer un gros budget pour votre chambre à Londres, cet hotel fera parfaitement l'affaire. | Ne vous attendez cependant pas à un hebergement sentant le neuf et spacieux. Je ne sais pas si ça existe à Londres à moins de 200 Euros la nuit.","Alenya, France",12/17/2007
Rhodes Hotel,5,Freundliche Unterkunft,"Dieses B&amp;B Hotel ist dank der Lage zu Paddington Station (Anreise mit Heathrow Express) und Tube Stations (3 Min) eine sehr gute Wahl. Man kommt schnell ins Zentrum, der Hydepark ist in einigen Min. zu Fuß gut erreichbar. Ausserdem stimmt das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. | Unser Zimmer war im 4. Stock, ohne Lift etwas mühsam, doch mit Kofferservice ok). Wie meistens in London, war auch hier das Doppelzimmer eher klein. Es war ausgestattet mit FlatscreenTV, Kühlschrank, Schreibtisch, Kleiderschrank. Eigenes Bad (Dusche mit WC). | Das Bad war recht neu und hygienisch mit Ventilator. Das Bett war komfortabel, Laken sauber. Teppichboden war schon etwas abgenutzt aber ansonsten sauber. Fenster konnte man öffnen. | Der Frühstücksraum befindet sich leider im 1. UG. Für ein kurzes Frühstück aber kein Problem. Frischen Toast gibt es automatisch auf jeden Tisch. Kaffee, Tee, Marmelade und Früchte waren reichlich da. Käse und Wurst sparsam. Auf Wunsch English Breakfast. | Die Zimmer sind sehr unterschiedlich ausgestattet. Manche komplett oder teilweise renoviert. Wer nicht viel Geld für eine Unterkunft ausgeben möchte und einfachen Komfort mag ist hier richtig.",Freiburg,12/5/2009

The Rembrandt,4,Perfect location!,"Stayed here a few weeks ago on a quick stop-by for two nights. Excellent location for walking to many touristy locations but we were pleased to find around the corner a fantastic little square with coffee shops, pubs, and restaurants. Located near the tube as well! Staff was very polite and helpful. Accommodations were nice but the walls seemed a bit thin. Pretty sure we heard the folks above us ""jumping"" on the bed. ;) | Our favorite part about this hotel was the lounge. Each evening when we returned from walking and sightseeing we would stop off in the lounge, chat with other guests, enjoy a glass of wine and then head up to bed. | Wonderful location, would definitely stay here again!","San Diego, California",5/1/2015
London Guest House,3,Hotel in West London,"Cercavo una struttura per una sosta di 1 giorno nelle vicinanze dell'aeroporto di Heathrow, con parcheggio gratuito e nell'ovest di Londra per motivi personali: la scelta è ricaduta su London Guest House, spinti anche dall'allettante tariffa di 99 £ per una camera tripla, solo 2 settimane prima (prenotato tramite portale online). Ci siamo trovati abbastanza bene, anche se probabilmente per un viaggio a Londra non l'avrei mai presa in considerazione perchè tendo sempre a soggiornare centralmente nelle città in cui mi reco; ma questo caso era diverso e comunque mai dire mai! | STRUTTURA | BB classicamente inglese, edificio basso in muratura bianca in basso e mattoni a vista la parte alta, adiacente ad appartamenti privati fatti nello stesso modo, in una via come ce ne sono infinite nel quartiere e in generale. Si sale alle camere tramite consuete rampe di scale lunghe e strette; l'ultimo piano è ""mansardato"" quindi il soffitto è inclinato (da ricordare per chi, alto, può non gradire). Parcheggio piccolo, meno di 10 posti auto, ma comunque c'è e a noi serviva assolutamente. | CAMERA | La camera tripla (matrimoniale + singolo) è piccola, come da aspettative, semplice, in ordine; la moquette è in condizioni abbastanza buone, così come il frigo e il bollitore con tè/caffè. Bagno microscopico, ma okay. Wi-fi altalenante, funzionava meglio nella hall. | RISTORANTE / CIBO | Colazione a buffet inclusa nel prezzo: essenziale, non cose ricercate ovviamente (bisogna sempre valutare il genere di posto), pane da tostare e marmellate, yogurt, brioche, un cenno di salato; bevande un tantino dozzinali (certo dipende dalle aspettative e noi italiani le abbiamo altine). Già presentare il tutto un po' meglio migliorerebbe secondo me, invece dell'aspetto un po' raffazzonato e basico dell'allestimento buffet. | PERSONALE / SERVIZIO | Personale molto gentile e disponibile, l'approccio è stato sempre col sorriso. | POSIZIONE | L'hotel è in West Acton, a 5 minuti a piedi dalla stazione ferroviaria ""Acton Main Line"" (ogni mezz'ora, credo, un treno per Paddington) e a 15-20 min a piedi dalla fermata della metropolitana ""West Acton"" e dalla stazione/fermata ""North Acton"" (Central), quest'ultima forse più facilmente raggiungibile perchè in linea retta da Horn Lane, da dove, accanto all'hotel, si può prendere un autobus. Nelle immediate vicinanze ci sono un paio di minimarket (tra cui Sainsbury), una farmacia e un benzinaio; locali per mangiare/bere poco più su verso la stazione. | In 25 min si arriva a Sheperd's Bush e al gigantesco centro commerciale Westfield. Per portarsi in centro città i tempi quasi raddoppiano considerando il tragitto per arrivare a una stazione e quello del mezzo di trasporto.","Turin, Italy",2/5/2018
The Rembrandt,2,"Great location, not so great Hotel","If you love having aggressive maids enter your room when you've requested not to, then this is the hotel for you. | If you love terrible breakfast that's not worth getting up for, then this is the hotel for you. | If you love hearing the arguments &amp; door slams down the hall way from your fellow neighbors, then this is the hotel for you. | The hotel itself has a great location, the rooms are fairly spacious (tiny bathroom with mold growing on the ceiling), &amp; the elevators work. | The hotel staff don't seem that interested in actually helping. There are a set of annoying stairs out the front, with no luggage access. No one tries to help you up those stairs, &amp; they really aren't approachable, so my stay felt very uncomfortable. | The room service staff can't understand what you're ordering down the phone. | The thing that turned me off the most about this hotel was the aggressive maid service. They ignore do not disturb tags. They're knocking outside rooms from 8:15am. They call your room several times throughout the day to ask repeatedly if you need the room cleaned when you've requested not to. I left the door chained my entire stay, scared one might walk in on me in the shower. | This hotel really had potential to be so much better, but it turned out to be quite an unpleasant stay. I wouldn't recommend it for what you're paying for unless you really can't find a better option.","London, United Kingdom",6/23/2015
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Wonderful weekend base,"From check-in (with the very smiley and helpful Carmen) our whole stay was perfect. We had originally booked to stay as a joint anniversary and birthday trip but had to re-schedule for 4 months later. They still remembered and brought us a hand written card, red rose and chocolates. Wonderful, thoughtful touch. | Room (junior suite) was spotless, very well equipped and quiet and comfortable. Brilliant bathroom. Only dispointment was we didnt have longer to relax in the room! | The area is like a ghost town at the weekend but a short taxi ride or a few stops on the tube takes you right to the heart of the west end. | A great experience, thank you, we will be back.",Bedfordshire,7/22/2013
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",5,BEST HOTEL EVER,"Whe stayed at the hotel a second time this year , and whe have just one word for the staff and the entire hotel accomodation , wonderful.Therefor they can expect us back in 2014!!! | It is more pleasant to stay in a small luxurious , than a big hotel , because the service is more personal , something the staff of The Wellesley clearly understands. | Many thanks to all","Poperinge, Belgium",11/24/2013
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Fantastic,"Second time at this hotel. Staff is fabulous, courteous, knowledgeable, professional. Lobby and restaurants very good and stunning. Spa is one of the nicest and most dramatic I have ever been in... Ask for a massage by Hezmat; he was incredible. Rooms - the showers are the best I have ever been in, white Calcutta marble everywhere. Spacious, quiet rooms, and hotel is planning a update which will be great. Location is great for theatre and Westminster, right across from embankment station. Hard to stay anywhere else!!",NA,10/28/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Birthday weekend,"I took my boyfriend to London for a 30th birthday surprise and chose the Mondrian for our hotel because of the location and the spa facilities. I got in touch in advance with Luke from Guest Services who generously arranged champagne and chocolate cake to be in the room when we arrived. We had a room on the top floor with a fabulous view of central London. We visited both bars which were beautiful and the spa treatments were top quality. All of the staff were very relaxed, friendly and helpful. Couldn't fault this place.",NA,2/13/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Great experience,"I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone that goes to London, England. It's central and walking distance to everything. This hotel is super modern and the staff was very helpful. We booked our ride on the London Eye through the concierge and thank goodness, he suggested we upgrade and avoid a huge line up and we were very grateful, the line was extremely long.....probably a one hour to hour and a half wait otherwise. The restaurants nearby were great and access to bicycle rentals were everywhere. All in all a super time in London, England | | | |","Val Caron, Ontario, Canada",6/2/2015
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Friendly budget hotel,"I've stopped here many times, and that seems to be a common theme with many of the guests. I was recommended it, and recommend it myself now. | It's certainly not plush, and you have a choice of en-suite or shared bathroom facilities, but they are always clean. | The rooms are basic, but clean. There are not tea and coffee facilities, but you can get a drink at any time from the lounge on ground floor. | With friendly proprietors, and the central location (only minutes walk from Euston). I expect I'll be back here many times more.",UK,11/30/2014
The Savoy,5,Exceptional in almost every way,"Despite growing up in London I rarely visit nowadays, so it's a pleasure to stay at a hotel that adds to the experience of trips ""home"". I've previously stayed at the Dorchester, Lanesborough and Berkeley and the Savoy outperforms all three. It's less money too - on the Centurion package, at least. | Dinner in the River Restaurant was excellent with very professional, yet friendly, staff. | The American Bar was busy, perfect martinis, slightly haughty and sullen waitresses, but a manager straight out of dream hotel central casting. | I was slightly underwhelmed by the refurbishment. Somehow parts of it seem almost suburban. Nevertheless Americans will feel very much at home and maybe I was expecting too much - the Grande Bretagne in Athens remains my favorite ""marble palace"" hotel in Europe in the interior bling stakes. | The room was rather small, but I'd booked the cheapest room so serves me right for being a poor pensioner. Housekeeping is exemplary. | The pool, spa and gym are an oasis of calm, ideal for a half hour freshen up before drinks and dinner. | My sincerest thanks go to the lobby and door team who were incredibly helpful and gracious in assisting my wheelchair bound uncle when he joined me for a day out in London. | Top hotel!","London, United Kingdom",1/8/2012
The Savoy,5,Afternoon Tea,"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous afternoon - thankyou to theSavoy, fantastic ambience and interior and staff , great experience definitely recommend going there for any occasion, I felt so at home it was brilliant!","London, United Kingdom",3/21/2015
The Dorchester,3,Amazing-not so!,"For many years I had fantasised about staying at The Dorchester so when the opportunity arose I jumped at it. Needless to say, as one of the great British institutions, it's a lovely hotel however it is not fabulous. It has two lovely dining areas /restaurants albeit pricey. | I was extremely disappointed by the rooms! The corridors were creaky and narrow and the rooms pokey. There's no doubt it was tasteful decorated, however I was noisy -if the internal door wasn't shut and space was tight with a capital T. The double bed was very compact for 2, there was hardly any space to walk around it! Very claustrophobic! On a positive note the bathroom was spacious with delicious toiletries and good high pressure hot showers - and it you are a lover of hotel slippers- this one was good quality. | All in all - charming but not worth the price or reputation- that is in the standard rooms. | A word of advise- don't take your car!",london,11/28/2015
London Guest House,1,Bad experience,Everything was fine with the booking until our work men arrived and they had a double bed and a single bed in a triple room when we requested 3 single beds and the person I had made the booking with confirmed this with me on the phone. The manager then rang and was very polite and said he would see what he could do to sort this mistake. After speaking to the manager I then received a phone call from the member of staff I originally completed the booking with and he was very rude on the phone and started to argue with me saying I had not requested 3 single beds when I had. I found that the way they dealt with the situation was very unprofessional. Would not recommend.,"Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom",8/12/2015
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,A great hotel in the heart of London's Financial District,"I stayed four nights at the Apex London Wall. Beautiful property, immaculate throughout, very friendly and helpful staff. My room had a small balcony as well. | The hotel is in the center of what we Americans would call the ""Financial District"", near the Bank of England and other financial institutions. The area is very quiet during the weekends with almost no restaurants or other shops open, but room service at the Apex is splendid - every meal was much better than the surrounding offerings. The Apex is easily accessible from the Moorgate or Bank tube stations if you're inclined to take the train. Rock-solid property, excellent staff, I highly recommend and will stay again.","Midwest, USA",7/14/2016
The Savoy,5,The best service in the world,"Whoever first wrote ""There's no place like home"" had clearly never stayed at the Savoy. From the moment you arrive you are welcomed like an old friend into a beautiful and exceptionally well managed hotel. | The American Bar is a particular joy, this time I was welcomed by name by Alice (Glayzer?) one of the wonderful waitresses, even though I had not stayed there for 2 months! In discussing the cocktail menu with me we discovered that the recipe for the ""Wings"" cocktail noted in one of the descriptions, had been lost some time after WW2. Undeterred, Alice took the challenge and recreated it, by deconstructing the Aviation and Wingspan. Her eye for detail and open and welcoming nature had me and my colleagues returning every night of our week long stay. | The wonderful atmosphere of the Bar is also a function of Jon, the piano player, who not only entertains, but also provides exceptional service. On a previous visit I had requested a very specific song, which he didn't know. Without any further request, he went away and learned it and played it the very next time I walked in after 2 weeks away. | The rooms are great, good wifi for business (although the mobile phone coverage isn't great), comfortable and large. The location is stunning, with all the delights of London close by and easy access to transport for meetings further away. As you would expect the food is magnificent, particularly the breakfast. | It is the service though that makes this the best hotel in the world. From the cleaners, the front of house staff, Toru at the Concierge, the doorman who gave my sister a hug when she was crying as she left, to the stars of Alice and Jon. I have stayed in many luxury hotels across Asia Pacific, Europe and Asia. None come close, because none feel like home in the best city in the world.","The Woodlands, Texas",12/5/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,"Excellent option, great hotel and superb staff","I travel to London frequently, but had never stayed anywhere in the South Bank - could never find an appealing hotel. I really like the area - the riverside walk, the buzz of Borough market and Spitalfields (within reasonable walking distance taking the pedestrian bridge to the City) etc. Location wise, this hotel is definitely the best option for this part of London. | But it's not just the location. It's a brand new hotel, and it shows - the rooms, the bathrooms, the public areas.... it's all new, fresh and modern (in a twisted contemporary retro way). Plus, one has to credit HR management for an exceptional job selecting its staff. Everybody we met was nice, friendly, courteous and incredibly helpful, which really makes a difference even in a short stay like ours. | Here are three pieces of advice to fellow travelers: | One, book at least 10 days in advance, as they do have very competitive rates - we paid GBP 163 a night for a superior room excluding breakfast but including taxes and service fees, an amazing rate for a 5* hotel in London (it's even a competitive rate for a 4*!). I don't know how long this pricing policy will last (maybe it's just temporary as the hotel is very new, but let's enjoy it while it does!) | Second, request a room on the higher floors (14-15). If you cannot afford a room with a river view, ask for one on the higher floor facing the OXO Tower (a tip from another tripadviser, which is a very good one). | Third, do make sure you go for a drink at the Rumpus Room cocktail bar on the 12th floor - views are amazing and so are the cocktails - but note you have to book a place at the bar (yes, even if you go for a drink only and even if it's just for half an hour), so my advice would be to make a reservation at the time of hotel booking, as it is a hugely popular place and consequently normally fully booked (especially at weekends). | Two suggestions to hotel management: | One, a minor one: it would be good to put a towel rack or hook for hand towels near the sink (I could only hang it behind the bathroom door, which wasn't very comfortable). | Second, it would be good to coordinate matters with Rumpus Room to reserve a couple of tables to hotel guests who want to go for a drink but were unaware of the strict need to book (this was our case and of quite a few others in the little while we were there). | All in all, an excellent hotel and a great option - we will be back!","Bilbao, Spain",3/10/2015
Newham Hotel,1,daughters 18th Birthday,"Overall the room was acceptable, very basic but clean, however there was NO heating the windows were very draughty. We asked for a plug in heater but they had none left as other rooms needed them.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,3,Ok but not stunning,"Stayed here because of a deal on discount site. Room very nice, reception staff slow. | Everything in room mini bar very very expensive, not sure why hotels do this, as who but a complete idiot buys it??? | Coffee in riverside bar very nice. Did not have breakfast. | 5 min walk from Waterloo past ITV building. | Can't really see where this hotel fits in. | TV kept turning itself off. | Room looked at a busy building site.","Beverley, United Kingdom",12/20/2014
The Savoy,5,Superb 60th Celebration,"Having just spent 2 days there with a friend to celebrate our Birthdays, I can't praise the Hotel and all their staff enough, they made it a hugely enjoyable experience, from checking in in the comfort of an elegant lounge to then being escorted to the Thames for a complimentary River boat cuise, on our return we were shown to a beautiful elegantly furnished room complete with a welcoming chocolate birthday cake! We made use of both cocktail bars during our stay &amp; were lucky enough to be seated at the bar in the Beaufort bar where Lorenzo &amp; his colleague expertly talked us through the cocktails even making us up a special one to celebrate our birthdays accompanied by wonderful red rose complete with dry ice, a fabulous effect! Everything about the hotel was of the highest standards &amp; the staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was a memorable one, what a wonderful way to spend a special birthday.","Clitheroe, United Kingdom",7/6/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Great hotel,"Amazing hotel , would come back again | Enjoyed the two nights we stayed amazing bars and restaurants in and around the hotel.

Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Best hotel stay yet,"I Knew to expect more than normal when booking this hotel as i normally stay in travel lodges or ibis, but what i got i couldn't believe!!! | The staff on reception were extremely welcoming and greeted us as we walked in with big smiles and had an effortless time checking in, including prosecco. | The room its self was another level, i had booked the junior suite so knew it would be something to be impressed by, but it was even better ! | The room was spotless and had everything we could have asked for. The bathroom was spectacular as the bath was huge!! Being 6ft+ and broad shouldered i struggle with standard baths so this was an added bonus! | I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to london for work or pleasure as you would enjoy it for both.","Kessingland, United Kingdom",8/16/2016

Ridgemount Hotel,5,Perfect location and most affordable for London town,"We arrived after 24 hours flight early in the morning. Our room was still occupied and they offered that we could use the facilities in the lounge room, tea making facilities (great tea!) and the shared bathrooms. By the time we freshened up and settled down, the room was ready. | You need to know there are no lifts, however, I enjoyed the exercise as London has so much wonderful food, the stairs offered a bit of a cardio workout in the mornings and evenings. Some people may complain about the traffic noise in the front rooms - my advice is invest in good earplugs when you travel anyway as you never know what type of neighbours you will get, I did not find it a problem. | The room was cosy, I was in a twin share with bathroom. We walked in to the room and to the right of me was a door. It was a cheeky, spacious bathroom. Very clean, bright and warm. | Breakfast was ample and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. | The location impressed us the most, we were just so close to anywhere we needed to go. Close to bus stops to almost anywhere in London, Covent Garden, a range of theatres, walking distance or short bus trip to Kings Cross as well as Euston and Goodge Street Stations.",Sydney,11/28/2015

We have now stayed here 3 times and look forward to many more. | Service: | From the moment you are greeted by the bell staff (Rob, in particular is amazing) to the front desk staff (Agga and Philip very helpful) and the restaurant staff, you feel like you are being welcomed to your home away from home. | Rooms: | Luxury king art deco style with river view was exceptionally clean, pleasant with nice storage space. Not the most generous proportions but nice for two guests. | Food: | Breakfast at the Thames Foyer and Kaspar's was delicious. Dinner at Kaspars also very tasty with excellent choices, nice wine list and great service- they remembered our favorite table and 2 out of 3 times gave it to us. American Bar is a great setting for drinks- amazing, addicting stuffed olives!!! | In short, a spectacular five star hotel experience that is not to be missed.","Coral Gables, FL",11/1/2016

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Pure Class,"Everything about this place is flawless. I've stayed in most of the top hotels in London and this,as my favourite, is now the only one I'll choose. Location is great, in the middle of Knightsbridge. There's always loads of taxis passing by this area if you want to travel around London. The hotel backs on to Hyde Park so some of the rooms have amazing views of all the greenery. They have designed the rooms with the perfect balance - luxurious yet elegant and comfortable. The bar is great and try the cocktails. Concierge are always very helpful. The spa is consistently voted as one of the best in London. I've previously left things at the hotel between my visits. When I get back, they've unpacked my things and put them away in the cupboards. It's as if I'm coming home! The room service is fantastic. Not a bad word to say about anything and I'd thoroughly recommend it.","London, United Kingdom",7/6/2013

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",4,Good stay,fabulous stay. The hotel service is incredible. The only down side is that the hotel is very dated.

The Savoy,4,My 70th birthday,"Fabulous.! A very grand hotel, but we were welcomed so kindly, and simply had a glorious three night stay. We got an upgrade to an amazing suite overlooking the river, and gardens. I could have happily sat at the window looking at the view the entire time! | I have to mention the Concierge service, which was outstanding. Thank you Jamie. | The downside was the a la carte breakfast rather than a buffet (which we prefer). We didn't actually eat at the hotel other than breakfast. | The upside was the fabulous warm swimming pool which all 6 of us enjoyed. | The other downside was the famous bar. We arrived back from | Le Gavroche in a very favourable mood. We then had to queue - as residents - for 20 mins to get a seat. We were recommended certain cocktails by the waitress. They were awful and we sent them back. The atmosphere was non existent. Brittle and loud. The pianist had gone home.",United Kingdom,4/21/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Great chic London hotel with South Bank location and 'no name',"Next to the OXO tower and short walk from Festival Hall, National Theatre, Waterloo etc = great location. There is no signage - deliberate policy of owner (we were told) - doesn't help when trying to find it though! Very open foyer and design paradise. We just stayed for one night (secret hotel lastminute.com) but our basic room impressed us. Queen bed, funky decor, lighting, small room but cleverly angled and lit to give impression of space. Comfortable and very clean. Lovely waterfall, walk in shower and very tempting bar and extras in room (hence a £100 per night credit card deposit) - clever!! We gave in and used a few items. Had a problem in the bar - Bloody Mary was so full of Worcestershire sauce it was undrinkable - lots of apologies followed and a free bar and room extras bill was given to us without us asking. Impressed by staff. We did not find them pretentious, just helpful and willing to make our stay the best possible one. There was a busy check out but a member of staff approached us and did paperwork swiftly. There is a construction site across the way and work started at 9 am on a Saturday. It didn't disturb us too much but I can understand it this would irritate (especially if you are spending a lot of dosh). We would recommend this place though and plan to return.","Farnham, United Kingdom",12/7/2014
The Lanesborough,5,Perfect experience from start to the finish,"My experience of staying at The Lanesborough Hotel can only be described as experiencing what a hotel can be when it is at the very top of its game and at its finest. | I stayed at the Lanesborough for one night along with my mother on the day of my 21st Birthday as we were in London to enjoy the day and celebrate. From the moment we arrived at the door we were greeted with style and class by the expert doormen and porter team who swiftly showed us through to reception where the delightful Lilly took us through a very swift and easy check in experience. Throughout our stay (and based upon my previous experiences visiting the Lanesborough and other hotels) my mother and I both noted how excellent the doormen were- certainly some of the finest in London and always willing to welcome you by name back into the hotel and provide a cheery goodbye when exiting. As the first and last point of call when at the hotel these men have got their craft down to a perfection. | We were delighted to find upon check in that as it was a Birthday celebration and there was availability we had been upgraded from the Executive Room to a Premier Room, the hotel having been able to match my exact decor specifications in the room (special thanks for Mr Shard for taking down these details at the point of reservation)- I could not have asked for a room closer to my taste! Upon entering the room I was greeted by a delightful Birthday cake (due to a very minor issue with it however we were not able to finish the cake but from what we did try it was delicious) so a special thanks goes to Ms Bursfords guest services team for this wonderful detail . | Our room was extremely spacious, very light and airy with all the in room facilities helping make our stay effortless. The bathroom was beautifully appointed with the softest towels of any hotel my mother or I have visited. It is quite easy to miss many of the bathroom features and any slight little issues I could even think about raising could have been solved by the press of the 'housekeeping' button next to the butler call button. We choose not to do so as we found solutions to them ourselves so they really are not worth mentioning. In the morning we took breakfast, complimentary due to an offer whereby accepting a complimentary years membership of 'Leading Hotels of the World' (which will no doubt prove most useful!) meant receiving a complimentary breakfast, in our room. The service was excellent with the trolley arriving perfectly presented and set up by the team members with all host of delights available through the 'Lanesborough Breakfast' menu option. There was a minor issue given that we tried to split the times of two breakfasts after having initially ordered them to arrive together and the second ended up arriving early but I put this down to my not having been clear at the time I was amending the order, as it was I was happy to receive the breakfast earlier than I had planned anyway. While I dined elsewhere in the night my mother dined through the in room dining menu, ordered through the control hub tablet system in place in all rooms, and was extremely impressed that not only did the team who delivered it ensure it was set up well in room but they also were aware she had been to the spa and hence provided bottled water for rehydration and had the turn down service rescheduled so she could enjoy dining in peace- this was a consistent feature of our visit where needs were anticipated by staff before they were mentioned by ourselves. Her only comment was that she did not find it easier to find how to specify the delivery time through ordering on the tablet system (which strangely was easy to specify when ordering breakfast) but as one can order via the butlers or via the phone system this should not present guests with a problem. | The Butler service every hotel guest at the Lanesborough receives was second to none. It was wonderful that upon calling the Butler to help set up our Wi-Fi and opening the room door the truly delightful Bettina was there to wish me a Happy Birthday with an unrivalled smile and cheer. Our interactions with Bettina throughout our stay were perhaps the real highlights of the whole stay as positivity simply exuded from her and fill us both with smiles every time. If I am completely honest I was at first unsure what to think having painted the picture in my mind and had been eagerly anticipating experiencing the traditional gentlemen butler, but Bettina surpassed all expectations and was a real delight who we cannot thank enough for making our visit special. With the press of a button on her system Bettina, anticipating our needs following a passing comment about our train time, secured late check out for us as the room was not needed immediately so we did not need to vacate it as early as planned- this was very greatly appreciated and made life so much easier. All elements of the butler service really were first class. We did not sample every standard service the butlers offer (e.g. the drawing of a bath and unpacking) as we were traveling light and were only resident for a single night but my freshly shined shoes had never been so gleaming following sending them off to the butlers. | Both my mother and I visited the brand new Lanesborough Club and Spa in the in the evening and afternoon respectively. Upon my own visit Ernest and Mohammed the two spa butlers were as helpful as anyone could be and always made sure to keep me engaged and interested and answer any questions I had and I understand this was the same for my mother. One should always ask for directions to the new spa as it can be quite a warren of passageways to access the lift but the concierge team are adept at guiding guests through to the lift. The facilities at the new spa were first class, the only thing that was not operational on my visit was the post Sauna ice trough which was awaiting repair though this was working in the female thermal suite. The Hydropool, perhaps the star attraction of the new spa was one of my favourite experiences and was itself almost like a treatment given how relaxing it was. The array of products on offer in the changing rooms to use pre and post spa were also first class. I had a spur of the moment decision to try and book a pedicure when I arrived at the spa but sadly the painting room was fully booked during the free time I had, my fault for not booking ahead, so I would advise anyone wishing to have a treatment to let the team know at the very least 24 hours in advance to ensure the best availability and avoid disappointment. | While I was dining elsewhere my mother enjoyed first rate hospitality at the Library Bar, I know from having visited this and left reviews for the Library Bar before that it is a first class establishment and perhaps the cosiest in London. The team there went to exceptional efforts to ensure she was well looked after and entertained while she awaited my arrival and when I did arrive they had a special little cake prepared with a candle to say happy birthday and two glasses of house champagne- they could not have been more friendly and I shall certainly make the Library bar my bar of choice when in London. | This is clearly a hotel at the top of its game and Mr Gelardi has every right to be proud of his exceptional staff. I would always advise anyone looking to stay at this hotel or dine there to deal with the hotel directly (I experienced, due to a matter not directly related to my stay but related to the new Lanesborough website, prior to my stay dealing with the parent company, the Oetker collection, and found while they were polite the response times were slow on a matter where I provided them with what I would deem great assistance to them rather than vice versa. I was slightly indignant over the lack of acknowledgement for the recommendations I gave them which they acted upon but did not reply to this was put down to their efforts in dealing with a crisis elsewhere in the collection. All the same I must comment no such thing was comparable to the instantaneous service levels Lanesborough itself hence I would recommend always going to The Lanesborough as your first point of call over the collection itself or booking agencies). | I conclude by saying that while the Lanesborough might be my first London 'Grande Damme' hotel resident visit, it is by no means the first 'Grande Damme' non-resident visit and having had the pleasure of being inside the other hotels it is quite common to feel, following the attention the staff give you, that you wish you could be resident in the hotel full time, only at the Lanesborough however have I experienced the feeling where I wished I was not just resident there but actually working there, such was the dedication, good spirit, passion and sheer attention to detail of all the staff involved. I will be recommending the Lanesborough to all.","Cardiff, United Kingdom",10/21/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Urban Cocktail Hide Out,"We spent a couple of nights in this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is definitely a 'night hotel' with deem lights and dark decor, all in the best taste. Cocktails were fantastic and service impeccable. Staff was very friendly (and quite relaxed and familiar). The only issue was completely independent from the hotel's powers (a drunken guest kept on knocking on our door thinking it was his date's room, at 4, 5, and 6 in the morning in an increasing state of undress).","London, United Kingdom",10/12/2015
The Rembrandt,4,"Lovely spa experience, not such a lovely afternoon tea experience!","Myself and 3 friends visited the hotel at the weekend as part of a spa and afternoon tea package. We enjoyed the spa part of our visit, it is a small spa but we liked this as it added to its appeal. It wasn't overcrowded as some bigger spas can be at time, as part of the package we each had 2 treatments and we were all happy with these and the therapists were friendly. Unfortunately our visit with spoilt a little bit by the service of one of the restaurant/ bar team when it came to having afternoon tea. Firstly a table wasn't ready for us despite this being booked and me phoning to confirm, not a massive problem and we are not unreasonable we ended up sitting at a table within the bar area which was fine but the attitude of this particular member of staff didn't help the situation. His response when we asked about our table was that he didn't know what his colleagues had done and he had only just arrived, not very helpful! To be honest, his attitude didn't get much better from then on, he looked completely disinterested and bored and there was barely a response offered when my friend asked him for some milk which he had not bought over with the tea originally as we would have expected. It was just a shame as the quality of the food was good and had the service been better the experience would have been great. I would like to add that this shouldn't be a reflection on the other staff members, his colleague who was working behind the bar was great, friendly and personable. All in all we had a nice afternoon and would definitely return to use the Spa facilities.","Surrey, United Kingdom",1/23/2018
The Dorchester,5,First Class Luxury Hotel!,"I stayed in the Dorchester with my husband Saturday just gone for 2nights. We had a wonderful stay. I booked about 5days in adavance on the website, got a great deal for £529 in a Superior double room. Its the lowest grade room they do, but you wouldn't think it! It was amazingly comfortable. Classic English beauty, a gorgeous bathroom with the most luxurious deep bath! :) | When we checked in, we were told we had a complimetary upgrade as we were celebrating a birthday, but was soon told there had been a mistake...We wasn't too fussed. Our room wasnt ready so they offered us drinks in the bar. | When we arrived in our room there was complimentary champagne on ice, chocolate covered strawberries and a lovely choc birthday cake which was all lovely. | I really cnt fault anything about this hotel, we wil definatley be returning. | I wouln't reccomend it to anyone on budget though...2hours in th bar with about 6drinks 3of which non-alcoholic and a club sandwich came to about £166....Second night we had dinner in the promenade, which was wonderful. Fairly priced too £75 for 2meals, 1 desert and 4soft drinks. | Service is second to none, especially the room service breakfast. Cooked to perfection and enough to feed a small army! | Will definatley be returning this year and cant wait! A true Gem of London.",london,10/23/2008
Corinthia Hotel London,5,"Incredible incredible hotel, spa & staff","Wowwwww what can I say.. my wife and I had the pleasure to stay here for 1 night in an executive suite. We were using some credit we had back from our honeymoon and decided to use it toward a night in london. I only wish we had of known about this place sooner. | Im from brighton but living in Mexico with my wife who's from New York. We wanted to be tourists for a couple of days in london but this place was so amazingly good we couldn't be bothered to use our 2 day hop on hop off tickets and stayed mainly at the hotel only using Uber and a bit of bus time to grab a bikini and shorts from Harrods because we'd forgotten to bring our swim stuff for the spa. | I overheard a guy saying it's the best spa in london and I shrugged it off thinking 'yeh right' but worth checking out all the same. When we got down there after our little shop and coffee at harrods it was like stepping in to the most trendy lounge bar but it's actually a spa. It's super modern, the design is out of this world and the atmosphere and detail is amazing. I don't know who designed this place but you can see their passion has gone in to it down to the last shadow gap and floating edge to lighting feature. | The 360 glass sauna is as cool as it looks on the pictures and actually everything here is as good as its looks online. | We have fallen in love with the place all round and would love to return (if we can find a good deal as it's not chap) when we return in the summer from Mexico. | The staff are well trained and excellent communicators and very friendly not snooty as you might expect at this end of the market. | Nothing was too much or too difficult if we asked. They were very flexible with check out times and taking care of our bags etc. We were also allowed to use the spa before leaving to catch our train. | The concierge were very helpful and tried their best and came through above and beyond what we asked them to help with. | Nice atmosphere everywhere and cocktails might be pricey but well made and strong :-) | Can't wait to come back (if we can) | Oh and perfect location for everything we even walked from watching the changing of the guards at Buckingham palace here and only took 15 mins. Nice walk through the park. | It's near everything you might want to go to in london but beware this place is so good you might not end up doing half the things you intended to do. That's what happened to us haha | Enjoy corinthia, the best hotel in london if not the best in most countries of the world. | 5 stars !!!!! | K and j","Orlando, Florida",3/18/2017

Stayed in the Family Suite which is actually 2 separate rooms behind a door into the elegant hallway. Our own butler made sure that whatever we needed was made available expeditiously. Exceptionally clean, tons of history, two great restaurants and rock star general manager (The Scottsdale Fairmount has never been the same since he left to manage the Savoy) make this the hotel to choose if you are looking for an effortless stay.","Coto De Caza, California",4/12/2015

Harrods is within walking distance. The rooms aren't huge but pretty good for the area. You have your choice of many places to eat within walking distance. Staff was great when we were there. Didn't get to try the bar area but everything was clean and well taken care of. Best feature for us was the breakfast, it was always good and made starting the day easier.

The Savoy,4,Beautiful hotel but bedroom let it down,"Positives : | The main rooms downstairs are breathtakingly beautiful. We had breakfast in the Thames Foyer room and honestly just having breakfast was an occasion in itself. THE best breakfast dining experience we've ever had. If you want to feel like royalty you must pay the extra for breakfast in the Thames Foyer room. | The staff were all fantastic. Passing them in the corridor and they all say 'hello how's your day going' etc. | Negatives: | We paid £880 for 2 nights in a deluxe room inc breakfast. For this money the bedroom should have been perfect. It wasn't. | When we arrived at around 10pm we were tired and a little warm from walking. We were shown to our room which was a very warm &amp; uncomfortable 27C. (The room temperature is shown on the air conditioning controller). There was air conditioning available but nobody at the Savoy had thought to switch it on before guests arrived. Instead we were left to boil until the room cooled down. Not a good start. | We had 2 nights of very poor sleep quality. | First night the air conditioning needed to be permanently switched on because of the heat but the problem was the air conditioning unit was very noisy. Even switching the air con to its lowest setting, it was still very noisy which kept us awake. Never had this problem ever at another 4 or 5 star hotel, just at the Savoy. | 2nd night we were woken at 4:45am and kept awake for around 20 mins by shouting in the room next door. Again not good and never ever had this at any other hotel. | The Savoy is a 5 star hotel, our room cost £440 a night so why do the Savoy think it's ok the charge guests extra for wifi? Aren't we already paying enough? £9.95 for 24 hours wifi. Disgraceful. | Again, £440 a night and no tea or coffee provided in the room, no iron and ironing board permanently in the room. Why? Surely you can afford it Savoy management? | I'm afraid all the extra penny pinching by the Savoy and the poor sleep quality spoilt our stay slightly. For the very high prices guests pay to stay at the Savoy, it should be perfect but sadly it isn't.","Helmshore, United Kingdom",7/29/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Superb,I took my husband to the Corinthia for his birthday last Saturday 24th March.

We didn't want to leave and will certainly return as soon as we can. | If you are looking for a recommendation before you book then don't hesitate - you will not find a better hotel in London - I stayed at the Savoy with my mother last year and on balance I think this was a much nicer hotel with friendlier staff.,England,3/30/2012
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Perfect rooms,"We recently booked three rooms for our family of six and had the most wonderful stay. The beds were the most comfortable and the showers were the best we ever experienced in a hotel room. The lobby area was spectacular and if there's one thing that I thought was a bit substandard was the quality of breakfast especially for the price. I expect London to be expensive but for 34 pounds, I thought would have been better. Also when they say a la cart for eggs, they mean it.

The room was fine, bed comfie, service and staff exceptional, but the lack of turndown service, lack of bedside water bottle, having a decent sized room - especially by London standards, but that looked out on a light well and a tv screen that simply would not stop glowing all night detracted from the exceptional meals and strong service. I wouldn't go back.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates",8/29/2014
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,A good business hotel for one or two nights,The Apex London Wall is a pretty good hotel for business purposes. All the usual amenities. The staff are very attentive. Location ia fine although some taxi drivers struggle to find it! I would recommend this hotel for one or two nights.,NA,4/18/2013
The Savoy,5,Exceptional hotel,"Stayed here for a weekend in February | The stay was faultless. Rooms are beautifully appointed, public areas amazingly decorated and the food and bars wonderful | If I had to praise one single thing about The Savoy above all else - it would be the service of the staff. I have never experienced such flawless, seamless and ""above and beyond"" service anywhere. | A delightful experience!",NA,3/10/2013
Rhodes Hotel,3,Good for short stay.,"I got the booking done just a few days before my travel &amp; this was the cheapest deal in that location. Frankly speaking i didn't expect much. | The good thing about this hotel is its proximity to Paddington station. Just get off your flight, board the Heathrow express, get down at Paddington &amp; in a few minutes you will be at the reception of Rhodes hotel. The staff is really friendly &amp; helpful. They give you genuine advise about whatever you enquire.. from buying basic amenities to sightseeing &amp; so on. | The room itself was not bad, but was pretty small with just enough space for my bag (I was in a single regular room, don't know about others). Basic things like wardrobe, study desk, T.V., hairdryer &amp; coffee maker were all there but squeezed into this tiny place. I was out most of the time so these things didn't make much difference to me. The breakfast was pretty basic with cereals, fruits, buttter-jam-toast &amp; unlimited tea-coffee. However, on my second day the serving person was kind enough to provide me with complimentary fried eggs. | So, if you are on a short trip &amp; wanting to stay downtown with easy access to public transport.... go for it!",Doha,3/22/2013

The Rembrandt,4,warm friendly and relaxing,"This hotel was chosen for its location and cost. The booking process on the sarova website was simple. We chose the Classic room and were allocated 641 on the sixth floor. The room overlooked the front of the hotel with the Victoria and Albert museum in front of us and Harrods further down the road to the right. Quite small but very adequate with a nice bathroom with whirlpool bath. A safe was also provided which helps with security, together with a complimentary tray for hot drinks. I thought that the mini bar was quite expensive. Breakfast was included in our nightly rate and this was fresh and plentiful, almost a meal to set you up for the day. | One minor niggle was that the room was not ready at 2pm, but we only had to wait 20 minutes and was worth it. I would definitely use this hotel again.","Ipswich, United Kingdom",12/13/2017
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Squeaky clean establishment,"First class service, first class room, first class and incredibly spotless bathroom, great location for the city and the staff were exceptionally helpfull.The best cooked breakfast we have ever had in any hotel ever, I will recommend to many.",Loch Lomond,7/1/2011
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Afternoon tea in Lobby Lounge and a tour of hotel.,"After having seen Corinthia London's photos (mostly computer generated) online, I was impressed enough to make a booking for afternoon tea. Being a new hotel, I was curious to see how their tea experience would compare to the long standing hotels: Claridges, Ritz, Dorchester and Lanesborough (The Big Four). | The hotel is right next to Trafalgar Square and Embankment Tube - easy access to Westminster, the West End and Buckingham Palace. St James Park is not far and the street itself, Whitehall Place is lovely and quiet. | Inside, the lobby is elegant. Clear vases of white arum lilies were scattered throughout the hotel. | Afternoon tea is served in the Lobby Lounge which is in between the hotels two main entrances. Personally, like the big 4, I would have carpeted the floor in the LL to distinguish itself from the surrounding spaces. The feel of the LL is very similar to Apsleys at The Lanesborough due to its sky light &amp; chandelier, but with less formal table settings. The decor is very polished, with natural light flooding from above. There are plans to open a side garden courtyard which will be a unique, welcomed feature. | Despite a few problems with our reservation confirmation, this was soon made up by a personal apology from the LL Assistant Manager, Mr. Carmine, who continued to serve us. This was an excellent touch and he couldn't do enough to make this a positive and lasting experience for us. | I was seriously impressive by the scones here. The cakes were nice too, as I find most hotel afternoon tea cakes look the part but taste bland. Not so here. The scones were perfectly formed, just warm and ever so crumbly yet stable enough to hold in your hand before gorging away at them. Inside, they were so fluffy, better, dare I say than Claridges which, up until now, served the best scones (Savoys were surprisingly large and chewy). | The selection of tea was average, not monstrous like the big 4 but of high quality. This was fine for us but for those who are serious about their tea selection, may demand more. My only concern when (not if) I visit again will be the seating arrangements. Like the Promenade in The Dorchester, the LLs table settings demand customers to share the same sofa as your stranger neighbour, and some tables were 10cm away from the next, neither which I am not a fan off. There are separate tables for you and your co, if so desired, which we had on this occasion, so do request this at time of booking. I did pass on feedback regarding the music they were playing from the speakers, which included Bob Dylon. I dont mind not having a live harpist or pianist playing during tea like the big 4 but tourists or even Londoners on a grand day out might expect this. I suggested they play classical music  its a safe bet. For me, good scones beat live pianists. All the other fine details I look for in an Afternoon tea experience were met. | Afterwards, I requested a tour of the guestrooms which also included the two restaurants and bar - all stunning, particularly the the Massimo restaurant and the fireplace in the Bassoon bar. The hotel is not finished, but I wouldn't let this put you off staying here. I noticed plenty of security. The guest rooms were cosy, modern yet stately in decor. Rooms have a city view or Juliet balcony (my preference), which reminded me of Paris. Homely touches avoid this from being a corporate hotel', which given it's location, could easily have been. The bathrooms are big and all have a window. Unfortunately the spa was unfinished so we were unable to view it  but it will be ESPAs global flagship spa, again with impressive CG images so no doubt Ill try this when it opens.","London, United Kingdom",5/6/2011

The Dorchester,5,Wedding Day - Magical,We were lucky enough to get married in the Dorchester. It was a wonderful experience. The hotel staff cannot be faulted in any way.

The Savoy,5,Flawless,"The Fairmont Savoy is nothing short of amazing - from the staff's attitudes in providing the best service in the world, to a classically preserved architecture, to the attention to every detail, nothing we have ever experienced compares to this iconic hotel. I assume that the only reason it isn't rated Number One in London is due to fewer reviews because it's recently reopened after an extensive renovation.... | My wife and I have traveled ""5-star"" around the world, and any Fairmont is consistently of highest standards. However, this particular property and it's exemplary staff provided us with simply the best hotel experience of our lives. | Book with confidence - you will not regret it.","Edmonton, AB",9/18/2011
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,5,THE VERY BEST!,"My wife and I have stayed at numerous Five Star hotels from Asia to New Zealand to Australia, to North America, to Europe, and to the Middle East. Without question, 45 Park Lane is ""the very best!!"". It excels in every category including overall equality, rooms, in room dining, service, and above all, Wolfgang Puck's restaurant Cut. | My wife and I were upgraded a one bedroom suite overlooking Park Lane and Hyde Park. We were at the hotel over Christmas and New Years and were able to see the bright neon lights from the Winter Carnival across the road in Hyde Park. We were greeted with a bottle of French champagne upon our arrival and the hotel General Manager invited us to see London's New Year's Eve Firework show on the Thames from the rooftop of the ajoinging Dorchester Hotel. | The hotel's location in the heart of Mayfair couldn't be beat. My wife and I had to take cabs everywhere because of our difficulties walking, but the usual cab fare was only five to six pounds. If we were able to walk, the hotel was only a short distance to Picadilly or Knightsbridge. The hotel did not have a separate concierge, but the front desk staff was well trained and handled these duties admirably. | It was a please have all of our meals served in our own private dining. It was very difficult | leaving the hotel when the room service kitchen was serviced by Cut for all three meals. And best off all, each meal arrived promptly and without out any delays. It was just like being served by your own butler at home. | The entire staff made my wife and myself feel like we were at home in Beverly Hills. Everyone addressed us by name and did their utmost to be extremely helpful. We found the prices for the restaurant and in-room dining to be very fair considering the quality of the food. Wolfgang Puck has always been one of our favorite chefs and it was a delight to find that he was in charge of the hotel's kitchens. | Our stay at 45 Park Lane was truly an exceptional event and made Christmas and New Years a very special time. The hotel's General Manager John Scanlon did everything to make our stay a memorable one. We plan to make 45 Park Lane our home in London during all our future visits to that city.",Miami Beach,1/8/2017

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Wonderful hotel but not for Christmas,"Beautiful and stylish hotel but it felt like we could have been staying anytime of the year. Not one Christmas decoration. According to staff this is the Morgan group policy. They advertise Festive/Christmas menus and celebrations yet don't feel the need to extend this to decorations. I would imagine most of the hotel guests were in London to experience the city at Christmas, they certainly didn't get it at the Mondrian. Luckily the Southbank made up for it.

Discreet and efficient, everyone went out of their way to make us comfortable and help enjoy our stay. | Yes it costs £400-£500 per night but if you want to treat yourself (it was my wifes birthday) then its worth every penny. I was happy to pay the bill as we had received excellent value for money. We are not super-rich or famous but were made to feel comfortable and pampered. The hotel was totally rebuilt and refurnished within the last five years, so nothing is worn-out or broken; but they have managed to retain all the old style and magnificence. | Pierre Bord from Le Negresco should come here and see how well a top class hotel can be managed.","Dunstable, United Kingdom",1/17/2016

The rooms are spacious and so comfortable. But a massive must are the bars. On the 12th floor is a stunning panoramic bar with views all around. Yes it is enclosed for chilly evenings. Vibrant &amp; busy. However, if you prefer more tranquil, try Dandelion on the ground floor. Voted number 1 cocktail bar in the world. Seriously, I can see why. Comfortable, great views, helpful cocktail waiters and, trust me, some you would never order but wow. Very creative. And tasty blends of flavour. | Outside is a Banksy Gallery, worth a meander.

Loved the idea of overlooking the Southbank so booked a deluxe river view room. | Very modern hotel keeping in with the maritime theme and worked very well . The room was large bright and airy the bed so comfortable and the view was amazing . The staff were very friendly and welcoming . Went to the Rumpus Room on the 25th floor a cocktail lounge with a terrace overlooking the Thames great vibe with DJ. Breakfast on the terrace looking out to St Paul's in the sunshine awesome.,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom",7/4/2015
Ridgemount Hotel,4,Virkelig rart sted at bo,"Det er tredje gang vi benytter hotellet og kommer meget gerne igen. | Vi rejste som familie med vores børn på 18 og 23 år. Da turen kun varede 4 dage besluttede vi at bo et fire-sengs værelse for hyggens skyld.Det var super fint. | Værternes interesse for gæsterne er helt særlig. De giver altid en god ide til et udflugtsmål eller giver gode råd om transport og lignende til et allerede planlagt udflugtsmål. Helt enestående. | Der er roomservice med rene håndklæder hver dag. | Morgenmaden er god og byder på forskellige muligheder. Serveringen er helt formidabel. | Vi anbefaler meget gerne dette hotel.... | I øvrigt ligger det så centralt - gåafstand til Oxford Street,,,","Nyborg, Denmark",12/8/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,"Ottimo in tutto, o quasi","Hotel nuovissimo, moderno, a 2 passi dal London Eye. Vicinissimo a 2 fermate della metro (700 mt da Southwark e Waterloo). Tutti gli spazi comuni sono molto ben arredati, cosi come le camere. Al 12esimo piano c'è un bellissimo bar dove sorseggiare un drink la sera, o un aperitivo il pomeriggio. Consigliatissimo | PS: l'unca ""pecca"" è la tv in camera, un hotel di questo livello dovrebbe avere dei dispositivi un tantino più nuovi.","Naples, Italy",3/29/2016
The Dorchester,5,Fantastic Experience,"Our first stay at The Dorchester, very impressive lovely room, comfortable bed with gorgeous pillows. Superb bathroom with fantastic shower. | All staff very attentive, would certainly visit again",Kings Lynn,3/21/2012
Ridgemount Hotel,4,Hotel familiar,"Segunda vez que fico neste hotel, e ficaria muitas vezes mais porque apesar de ser simples esta localizado em um ótimo bairro perto de tudo, fácil acesso a museus, metro, bus, parques e tem muitos lugares que da para ir a pé, por exemplo o Museu Britânico que fica a 300 m. Os quartos são bem simples, mas confortáveis, o atendimento é ótimo o pessoal do hotel é muito educado e atencioso, o cafe da manhã e interessante (britânico), mas bom. Recomendo muito esse hotel que fica em um bairro muito legal com varias universidades ao redor e muito bonito.","Aracatuba, SP",4/14/2015
Ridgemount Hotel,5,A happy stay in London,I spent three very comfortable nights in this hotel. My en-suite room was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Everyone I encountered was friendly and very helpful. The location of the hotel is very good. I would certainly recommend it and I will happily return there. I enjoyed my breakfasts too!! All in all it was good value for money.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",8/28/2013
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Brilliant!,"I have just returned from an amazing 3 night stay at the London Wall Apex. This is an amazing hotel. All the hotel staff that I met were fantastic, really helpful and courteous. Our room was lovely  a real feeling of quality, immaculately clean and some really nice extras e.g. Magazines, free water, free daily newspaper... | This is clearly a business hotel and it was very quiet at the weekend - but this didn't bother us. | | The bar was really nice and breakfast was pricey but good quality. | We will always stay here in future  loved it! | It is in the City, so a bit out of the touristy stuff  but really handy for Bank and Moorgate tube, so you can get around really easily. It is also in walking distance from Tate Modern, St Paul's and the Tower.",England,6/3/2010
The Rembrandt,3,Didnt meet expectations...,"My husband and I stayed at the Rembrandt hotel during our first trip to London. Reading the rave reviews we opted for this hotel as opposed to the Hilton The Rembrandt is a nice simple hotel with the basic amenities. The location is great and quick access to the South Kensignton tube. The staff were friendly and the hotel was clean. However I did not get the 4 star feel of this hotel. It could very well be a 3 star plus hotel. The full breakfast was very basic and could have had a wider variety. Breakfast was quite uncomfortable as we were place quite close to other patrons  similar to a dormitory style feeding session. | The rooms were a nice size. The bathroom was clean but the fittings were old. The walls in this hotel were very thin. You can hear the other guests walking past your room. This was very disturbing, if there is one thing that the Rembrandt needs to work on then this would be it. | On the whole it was a pleasant hotel to stay at but I wont return as I missed the elegance and sophistication that the Rembrandt lacked.","Johannesburg, South Africa",11/25/2011
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Great rooms,"Rooms were great, entrance, bathroom and bedroom. Very nice. No real desk, need to use round table so if that is an issue, beware. Well located. Was hosting a conference so did not have time to make full use of hotel but others at my company says its very good.","Riverside, Connecticut",6/24/2017
The Rembrandt,5,"Linda Campbell, Alabama USA",We traveled to London for a girl trip this month 04/08. We were very pleased with The Rembrandt..the breakfast was good and the staff friendly. We plan to stay at this hotel again in the future. The location is excellent. The area is very safe. The hotel was very helpful in helping us with directions. It is easy to find your way around London. Finding a place to eat around the hotel is not a problem. Check out all the pastries. We are looking forward to our next trip.,Alabama,4/24/2008
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Excelente,"Excelente. Recomendo esse hotel a todos. Apesar dos quartos pequenos, os demais diferenciais fazem a diferença. Limpeza, aquecimento, chuveiro ótimo, computadores a disposição, máquina de chá é café gratuitos... Realmente muito bom. Destaque para a equipe. Extremamente atenciosos. O café da manhã é ótimo, muito bem servido e incluso na diária, o que não é comum. Tem 3 meninas portuguesas que são muito educadas e atenciosas. Obviamente falam português o que pode ajudar muita gente. O dono ou gerente não sei, um senhor muito simpático, sempre preocupado em agradar é dar uma informação sobre passeios e transportes. Recomendo a todos este Hotel.",NA,2/18/2018
"Bulgari Hotel, London",5,Perfect Hotel in London,"I have been in many 5 stars hotels in London, but definitely Bulgari was the best! | Modern rooms and supper quite &amp; clean. Great in room dinning. Concierge was professional as you would highly expect...","Hong Kong, China",10/16/2013
Rhodes Hotel,5,We Felt Like Family!,"In all of our travels we have rarely experienced such warm hospitality as we felt at the Rhodes Hotel during our stay in March, 2008. The proprietors, Maria and Chris Crias, are wonderful, professional, and very friendly hosts! | Our reservations had been made directly with the hotel via the internet. All communications were prompt and professional, and there were no unpleasant surprises upon arrival. In fact, we arrived on a red-eye flight earlier than the official check-in time, but were cheerfully welcomed and offered coffee/tea/cocoa and croissants as we waited a short while for our room to be ready. | Our family of 4 (kids ages 12 &amp; 15) shared a Deluxe Family Room which was very clean; of sufficient size for the 4 of us; had a beautiful, newly remodeled en suite bathroom; TV; coffee/tea maker; refrigerator; climate control; a window that opened with a nice view out the front of the hotel; and remarkably comfortable beds. The hotel appeared to be full, but it was never noisy. Free internet was available, so our kids were able to stay connected with friends back home, and we could research additional travel information if necessary. | Breakfasts were ample and tasty. They included coffee/tea/cocoa, croissants, fresh fruit, orange juice, toast, jam, yogurt, ham, and cheese. Hot, made-to-order eggs were available for a small extra charge. We looked forward to Chris' cheerful service each morning and we sometimes lingered so we could enjoy his company, conversation, and humor. On Easter morning Maria surprised all the guests at breakfast with chocolate Easter eggs and treats -- a thoughtful, personal touch. | While never intrusive, Maria was always happy to advise and help with any questions we had about the London sights, transportation, etc. The neighborhood is full of restaurants of all kinds, shops, a laundromat, and is close to Paddington Station, the Lancaster Gate tube stop, and various bus stops. Lovely Hyde Park is within a few blocks. We always felt safe walking around the neighborhood, even at night. Although it's not a fancy hotel, the Rhodes Hotel was a cozy, welcoming place to come ""home"" to each night after a long day of sightseeing. We would stay here again without hesitation!","San Francisco, California",5/7/2008
The Savoy,5,Great stay ...BUT!,"We have stayed at the Savoy a few times and found it superb hotel in every way . Good food , excellent position , mainly very helpful staff and excellent room. | But we won't be returning again because of what happened on our last visit.","Kettering, United Kingdom",9/15/2014
Ridgemount Hotel,4,"Ottima posizione, grande cortesia","Ho soggiornato in questo albergo per una sola notte ma ci tornerei certamente, posizione centralea due passi da soho, comodo per vedere le maggiori attrazioni della città con una passeggiata. Personale cortese e disponibile, consiglio a tutti!","Milan, Italy",6/27/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Amazing hotel,"So it was mine and my husband one year wedding anniversary. On arrival,we were greeted by friendly staff. I requested for a room with a view and that is exactly what we got.. Breakfast the staff really went out of their way to accommadate our needs.. The room itself was spotless spacious and extremely clean.. Just how we like it. Such a comfy bed. I would highly reccommend staying here. Its a great location and so easy getting around.. Thank you Mondrian london. Keep up the hard work..",NA,4/26/2015
The Dorchester,5,A five star hotel delivering 5 star service,"Excellent service. Food was mostly very very good. Catering for a few hundred people at an awards dinner cannot be easy. Salmon with pea shoots starter was delicious. The sauce with the corn fed chicken was exceptional. Desserts and petits fours were executed ok but quite ordinary. Service was spot on and the best service at a big dinner I've been to. (Grosvenor, Marriott, Connaught rooms, Hilton park lane etc sometimes seem to have amateur jobbers doing it reluctantly for the evening). The area for the pre-meal drinks got way too hot and busy. The banqueting area was a perfect size where everyone could see and hear the speakers clearly.","London, United Kingdom",10/4/2014
Marble Arch Hotel,5,Gorgeous Tea Afternoon,Mariela and Alicia treated us really well and the hotel is spectacular! The food was lovely and we had a great time! Will def. come back! The price is a bit on the expensive side but The hotel is really worth it! Really close to marble arch!,NA,12/5/2017
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",5,Wonderful!,This was a wonderful experience. It is so unusual to find such warmth in Knightsbridge. | The courtesy and friendliness of the staff was surprising. Nothing was too much trouble. I will definitely return.,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",4/21/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Nice upscale hotel,"Stayed for 5 nights in the queen standard room. Room is not huge but a decent size and the bathroom rain shower is a nice touch. Bed is big and comfortable. Very quiet, didnt hear any noise from any other rooms or guests so quite relaxing. | There is a good gym with 4 treadmills, several bikes and lots of weights, nice facility. The breakfast buffet is ok, can be very busy and at these times the staff sub struggle. | Overall a good quality hotel, good location right beside the river.",NA,5/19/2018
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Birthday weekend made special,"We chose this hotel as we were celebrating my wife's birthday and wanted something special. The Corinthia impressed us in every way, from the minute we walked in to the minute we checked out. | The food, the staff, the decor, the room, the venue were all amazing. I completely agree with the awards the spa has won, as it is the best I've been to. | The hotel's phrase ""The Art of hospitality"" couldn't be more accurate! | I've never scored anything with full marks, but The Corinthia more than deserves it.","Cambridge, United Kingdom",11/22/2013
The Savoy,4,"Lovely building, great restaurant, rude management","The refurbishment has certainly given the Savoy an even more wonderful and luxurious feel. The decor is outstanding. I cannot in any way criticise the building, the environment or the restaurant. In the main, the staff were courteous and pleasant, too. | However, we found the duty management to be snobbish and rude to the point of hostility. One expects management at somewhere like the Savoy to be perhaps a little stand-offish, but not superior to the point of passive aggression. | The Savoy has more competition than it is perhaps used to, and, with great sadness, that's probably where we will go from now on.",London,4/24/2011
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Theatre Visit,"Beautiful hotel, can't fault the look and feel of the place, rooms amazing, bar was great. However the service in the bar and at breakfast was too slow. Also my invoice was very confusing and I am now left having to clarify this post my visit, which I just don't have time to do.",Swindon,7/25/2016
The Dorchester,5,The Dorchester,"One of the best hotels I have ever visited.Service is excellent. | Excellent restaurants and bars in the hotel. | I was amazed by a member of staff that could see a shopping bag was split and without any request or prompting, came along with a bag to ensure the shoping was not lost. Very attentive and observant.","London, United Kingdom",3/16/2016
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Unbelievable,"I have just been reading reviews of this fantastic hotel and am surprised! Many have said the hotel is dated - what do you expect from a building dating back hundreds of years! | I have only been here a few hours and am stunned by the sheer attention to detail, the room (upgraded!) has everything and more, the staff are lovely and the birthday cake brought to the room while we were out was a lovely surprise :) | I will update after I have slept here but, at the moment, I cannot fault this fab hotel! | I would recommend maybe booking Hyde park view if you don't want courtyard or street",Teddington,2/1/2014
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,El hotel perfecto en Londres,"No puede decirse que sea barato, ningún hotel en Londres lo es, pero la relación calidad precio es estupenda, la zona en el corazón financiero de la ciudad es fabulosa y la habitación, la limpieza, los detalles y la amabilidad del servicio simplemente geniales. | A cinco minutos andando de la estación de Liverpool, comunicada por tren y autobús con el aeropuerto de Stansted.",NA,3/23/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Uovertruffen service,"Bodde på hotellet i forbindelse med jobb, i et rom av typen Executive King. Flott rom og uovertruffen service. Hyggelig besøk fra start til slutt. Dørmannen ønsket velkommen tok bagasjen og ba om navnet. Vel inne i resepsjonsområdet ble jeg møtt med navn, rask innsjekk og fulgt opp til rommet med hyggelig forklaring av alle detaljer på rommet. Turn down service fungerte ypperlig ved å trykke på en knapp før jeg forlot rommet. Tilbake på hotellet var sengen klar til å sove i med en velduftende pose med lavendel på puten og en sjokolade fra Harrods ved siden av. | Concierge gav mange gode tips til steder å besøke i London som ikke er fullt av turister. Noe som gav en mer autentisk opplevelse av byen. | Etter en lang dag med møter, var det fantastisk å bestille en flaske champagne til rommet, slappe av i badekaret og se på kveldsnyhetene. | Flott business center for gjester, hvor jeg fikk anledning til å skrive ut og kopiere alt jeg hadde bruk for. | Frokostservering på rommet var også ypperlig. Nydelig frokost og full oppdekking der man selv ønsket. | Et hotell som yter det beste av service fra start til slutt, som jeg kan anbefale på det varmeste!","Oslo, Norway",3/26/2016
The Rembrandt,5,Honeymoon at The Rembrandt,"My husband and I have spent three fantastic days at this hotel. Friendly staff, clean and very comfortable rooms. Good food and drink. So near to many attractions. Would recommend and definitely come again. Mr and Mrs I Russell",london,9/24/2014
The Dorchester,4,a little on the old side,the hotel rooms are a maze to figure out at first and service quality at the front desk varies from really average to good at times. The concierge are definitely worth commending given their knowledge and ability to provide guests with timely advice. | My only gripe is on the price and the seemingly lack of attention for meeting rooms being booked for business meetings.,"Hong Kong, China",9/17/2014
The Savoy,5,The best customer service in the world?!,"We stayed at the Savoy for one unforgettable night over a weekend as a treat for my mum. From start to finish we were constantly surprised and delighted with the treatment we received. | Following a confusion with my original booking we were given an upgrade to a river view suite as part of the 'suite experience' and what an experience it was! | From our wonderful chauffeur Ben, who met us at the airport in a blacked out Range Rover, to our pilot (another Ben!) on the champagne river cruise on the Silver Darling, we really did feel like true VIP's! | All of the staff we came across knew our name, and were attentive to the last. An item of clothing I requested to be pressed while we had a swim appeared on our return, hung up in our wardrobe, a picnic I had ordered weeks before we arrived had not been forgotten about, our table for afternoon tea was moved for us to suit timings better with no trouble.....and a turndown service at bedtime complete with 'sleep well' mat next to our beds was just sweet. | The hotel itself is simply stunning with old world opulence and charm, full of history, it made you wonder who might have travelled these carpets, staircases and lifts in the days of film star glamour. | I could literally go on and on all day about this simply wonderful Hotel all day and night, needless to say it has ruined me forever, I will always compare any other hotel to the Savoy!","Guernsey, Channel Islands",7/29/2013
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",5,Another highlight on Park Lane,"2 years ago we were writing a review of the InterCont Park Lane promising to come back. Well, we didn't, but instead choose the Wellesley this year - and did not regret it. Admittedly, it might have helped that we got an upgrade to the Churchill Suite when booked a Junior Suite only. But in any ways, the hotel offers great pleasure. | Location is just great, as you can easily walk to Buckingham Palace, Picadilly or Harrod's. Service is great if you like Italian style (General Manager is Italian and so seems to be most of the staff). If you are a smoker you'll have plenty of options (Cigar Lounge plus heated patios). Non smokers are certainly disadvanteged. | Breakfast and dinner is great. Rooms are new and tidy. Free WiFi everywhere plus a tablet on the room for free use is just how it should be in all 5star hotels these days. | 2 Rolls Royce are waiting for you to drop you off within a 1,5 mile perimeter for free, however, it is on a first come first serve basis and when we requested it, the driver wasn't in at all, as service is obviously not available 24/7. | About 80 TV channels including Sky Sports. | We will come back next year (well, we promised that to the IntetCont so you better don't trust us;-))!!! |",Vienna,11/29/2014
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Great deal & good location,"An incredible deal for a centrally located London hotel. The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly. The rooms were spacious enough (especially for the price). We would definitely recommend this hotel to others. Rooms facing the street were noisy, ask for a room in the back.","Boston, MA, USA",7/18/2011
Ridgemount Hotel,5,"A nice, cozy and friendly hotel with good value","With a limited budget but little tolerance for the cleanliness, basic comfort and convenience of accommodation, I was really glad to have found this nice and cozy hotel in central London. Read the trip advisors reviews before I booked and am happy to confirm that all the positive comments about it were pretty fair and accurate. | The hotel is conveniently located in Bloomsbury (zone 1) with bus stops just across the street, and several tube stations within 5 mins walking distance (eg. Goodge Street and Russell Square stations). It is close to the British Museum (along the way to the Russell Square station), and just around the corner opposite to the hotel there is a large Waterstone bookstore. You can buy basic stuffs from Boots, M&amp;S, little Waitrose nearby the Goodge Street station. As it is within the university area, you feel pretty safe walking around even at night. On the other hand, you can also easily walk to the busy streets in the West End in around 20 mins. | We stayed in a double en-suite which was really small - but that was expected and I guess pretty much the norms for hotels in London. Besides, what could you expect for just over £90 a night with breakfast included? Other than the size, the room was clean and comfortable. The free in-room wifi connection added great value as we were able to google our way and plan ahead the transportation before starting our trip everyday. The English breakfast served every morning was also great - we always left the dining table with a full stomach and this saved us a lot as we found it rather expensive eating outside most of the times. | All the staff in the hotel are very friendly and helpful. The hotel owner, Mr. Rees usually shown up during breakfast time and would check if we have already planned for our day and give helpful traveling tips from time to time. Mrs. Rees is also wonderful and really really nice too. She suggested us going around by bus instead of tube which turned out to be very good advice as it was more comfortable, much cheaper, and allowed us to actually see more about the city. The local bus system is indeed well connected and easy to travel with as long as you google the route and bus stop locations in advance. | Overall I am very satisfied with this hotel and will definitely stay there again the next time I visit London.","Hong Kong, China",10/19/2012
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,5,Worth a visit,"We had four nights in a Studio Suite with a view of Hyde Park and it was 95% perfect which is good enough to give value for money. | The location is fine, the sound insulation is adequate and the overall standard of service is acceptable. | We are not the most demanding of guests but we do like to have permanent tea making facilities ie kettle, pot, cups, fresh milk, sugar and of course teabags available permanently. For some reason most hotels fail to get this right. Messages do not get passed on so what sounds an easily achievable task is let down by a slack attitude. | Over the 4 nights we were left with unwashed crockery and items not refreshed on 3 occasions. I know it isn't a tragedy but when a hotel wants to be classed amongst the finest then this should not be a problem! Our host laughed when I challenged her to get it right for the duration of our stay, first day - no teapot! | All in all, a good hotel but not excellent.","Brighton, United Kingdom",8/10/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Perfect City Hotel with Fab Design,"Great stay - comfortable but cool room, delicious food and drinks, friendly and helpful staff (except the girl on the door of the rumpus room but there is always one...) . Only regret is not trying the spa - next time.","London, United Kingdom",12/29/2015
The Savoy,2,Why do pompous?,My wife and I had a reservation for the savoy grill but had an hour to fill prior to sitting down for lunch. We decided on a coffee and approached the cafe manager for a table to be told that she was very sorry but they needed all the tables because they were to start afternoon teas service in 15 minutes. There were no patrons in the cafe at the time. Quite extraordinary. Sometimes I think the superior attitude of some staff at prestigious establishments needs to be adjusted. It was far more important for the manager to have a precise change over in service than to be of service to a customer. Oh well. The grill was good!,"London, United Kingdom",12/18/2014
The Dorchester,5,High Tea im Dorchester  ein Höhepunkt bei jeder Englandreise,"Das Hotel Dorchester in der Park Lane am Hyde Park ist eines der elegantesten Hotels Londons, viele sagen, es ist eindeutig das beste. High Tea, für den es täglich mehrere Termine von 14 Uhr bis 17:30 Uhr gibt, ist ein besonderes Ereignis, da Qualität und Ambiente einzigartig sind. Eine Buchung wird sowohl per SMS auf das Mobiltelefon als auch per e-mail bestätigt und es ist ratsam, lange vor dem geplanten Termin zu reservieren. Die Eleganz der Promenade, wie die exquisite Lounge des Dorchester heißt, wo High Tea serviert wird, ist unübertrefflich. Kleine Sitzgruppen in großzügigem Abstand gewährleisten private Sphäre und Raum für entspannte Gespräche im Geschäftsbereich oder auf privater Ebene. Dezente Klaviermusik gibt der Atmosphäre auch eine akustische Note. Ein Beispiel der angebotenen High Tea - Varianten: der Champagne Afternoon Tea., der in mehreren Gängen serviert wird. Es beginnt mit einem Glas Laurent-Perrier NV Champagne und einer Auswahl hochwertiger Sandwiches: Cucumber with cream cheese on caraway seed bread, Egg mayonnaise with shiso cress on white bread, Chicken with wholegrain mustard mayonnaise on basil bread, Smoked salmon on granary bread, gefolgt von: Warm raisin and plain scones served with homemade strawberry jam, a seasonal jam and Cornish clotted cream, wieder gefolgt von einer Auswahl an French pastries, alles begleitet vom wichtigsten, einer Auswahl an speziell ausgewählten seltenen Teesorten, unter denen man wählen kann.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Stunning London Hotel Mondrian with the personal touch,"My wife Rachael and I stayed at the Mondrian on Saturday 9th July for our anniversary and it was a wonderful stay. We arrived in the stunning lobby which is based upon the great transatlantic liners of the twenties with a huge hull curving around the from reception to the restaurant made from copper panels riveted together and cool Barcelona style furniture. We were greeted by Jessica on reception who made us feel truly special and welcome, she asked if it was a special occasion and when we said it was our anniversary she called over the manager who allocated us a fantastic 11th floor room with views of the Thames, St Pauls etc.It was such a refreshing change to be treated so personally in a London hotel ,a great start. | Our room was lovely ,spacious, beautifully finished, with a luxurious marble shower room, full media connectivity and a very comfortable bed. | On Jessica's recommendation we tried the Dandilyan cocktail bar on the ground floor for marvellous cocktails and later the amazing skyline bar Rumpus Room on the 12th floor with incredible views across the city and a very chilled vibe. | In the morning we went to breakfast where you can choose to eat inside or outside on the riverside terrace, it was the best breakfast buffet we have enjoyed in any London hotel with everything you can imagine laid out and cooked to perfection. | The location of the hotel is excellent on the Southbank in easy walking distance of the OXO tower, Festival Hall, National Theatre, Globe theatre. | We will definitely be staying at the Mondrian again soon and would like to thank everyone there for such great service , especially Jessica for looking after us so well upon arrival.",Broadstone,7/12/2016
A To Z Hotel,2,"Filthy, Unhygienic",This hotel is not at all good value for money. It is very filthy and unhygienic. There was no working TV as advertised and the noise level is too high for someone to get some rest. the bed sheets are not that clean. I will never recommend this hotel again for the money paid.,"London, United Kingdom",2/16/2016
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Love this place,"I love this place, the feeling of being somewhere special starts as soon as you clap eyes on the place. Staff are so attentive - without being in your face - from the door being opened by a smiling face with a big red coat (So English!), to the Floor Managers that look after everything you could possibly think of. The spa is heavenly (Very Zen!), the bar is rocking and the restaurants are serene places quietly dishing up the best of the best - lots of organic! Splash out and go for a Hyde Park view, you'll be one of very view with access to such a stunning sight as soon as you open your eyes after a good nights sleep - pure Irish linen sheets - the ultimate indulgence! | I've stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world but Mandarin Orientals really are my favourite.",Melbourne,12/14/2004
The Savoy,5,American Bar review,Tons of alcoholic choices to your heart's (or liver's) content with a great level of service that is both warm and welcoming. They have a pianist for easy listening entertainment. It was a great way to conclude my trip in London.,"Los Angeles, California",9/12/2014
The Savoy,5,Beautiful,"World class, not much else to say. Exactly what you could have hoped for. Just do it. Great little chocolate shop just off the foyer and 5 seconds away from the savoy theatre.

The Rembrandt,3,Great location,"We stayed there for 9 nights. We arrived early in the morning to get our room as we booked an early check in at 10 am. However, the room wasn't available but nice Tina at the reception desk compensate us with an upgrade from superior to executive. The rest of the reception staff are not pleasent to deal with them.

Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Excellent!,"We loved staying at the Apex on New Years. The service was as good as you would expect from a 4 star hotel, even allowing a late checkout free of charge. The facilities were absolutely excellent and the whole room layout was just great! Not to mention the free rubber duck, jelly beans, pringles and mineral water :) Would definitely recommend to anyone!","Hatfield, United Kingdom",1/30/2012
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Beautiful hotel and excellent service,"Really happy with the stay - the hotel is amazing, especially after the previous night in a Travelodge. | The staff were extremely friendly, helpful and professional. The room was gorgeous, clean and there were some lovely extras such as snacks, dressing robes and slippers. | We had one issue with the breakfast - overcooked boiled eggs that came to our room in the morning, but the staff kindly didn't charge us for this after we mentioned it. So I can't fault them really. | Highly recommend this. Look forward to visiting again.",Edinburgh,2/1/2012
The Rembrandt,4,Carino,"Siamo stati in questo hotel per 4 giorni a cavallo di Natale e l'ultimo dell'anno. Hotel in posizione poco distante dal centro e pur non potendoci arrivare a piedi non ci siamo però svenati con i Taxi. La struttura è quella classica degli hotel di città , un pochino datato ma comunque carino e ben tenuto. Purtroppo il personale non parla assolutamente la nostra lingua ma é stato molto cordiale nel cercare di capire le nostre richieste. Camere ben tenute e pulite con riassetto giornaliero. Colazione a buffet abbondante , buona e con tanta scelta. Non abbiamo mai provato il ristorante essendo fuori tutto il giorno e ci siamo accontentati del servizio al bar che é comunque risultato di buona fattura fornendo una buona disponibilità di bevande e snack (pizza , panini , sandwich e addirittura la pasta) con orari molto ampi di apertura. Wi-Fi gratis in tutto l'albergo molto veloce. Esperienza positiva che consigliamo a chi non ha esigenze molto elevate e si accontenta della normalità quotidiana. Camere dotate di tutti i confort base : TV , cassaforte , asciugacapelli e bagno di media grandezza. Giudizio quindi positivo.","Vimercate, Italy",1/1/2016
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",3,I tried to like it...,"Great location between two different tube lines, next to a grocery store with a Starbucks. The hotel is very clean, and staff very courteous. My room was unbelievably small for the equivalent of $220 USD, so small that I didn't want housekeeping in because I'd have to repack for anyone but me to enter! Barely room for luggage rack, which I had to request. They have a mat on the bed that says ""luggage here,"" however, I don't like sleeping with my suitcase. Breakfast chintzy, so I ate next door at Starbucks in the grocery store. I love Marriotts and have had good luck with Autograph Collection, but won't stay here again.","Westport Point, Massachusetts",6/16/2017

I am not sure if we'll be back though and I docked a mark as I felt it could do with a little upgrade and it doesn't have a bar to have a few drinks in. We were with 2 other couples and wanted to just chill and chat somewhere when we came back to the hotel but there was nowhere to go. | Service and staff cannot be faulted in any way.

The Savoy,4,Choose an Art Deco room for sure...,"My girlfriend treated me to a stay at The Savoy, and it was unforgettable. I work in the industry at a neighbouring 5* hotel so was interested to see how elegant the service and property really was after its £100m refurbishment. I was not disappointed. | The locations is brilliant for the theatre land (West End) but not that great for shopping. Knightsbridge is far better - which is a 15 minute taxi to the west of the hotel. | The lobby area is tidy and well run and you can immediately tell you have entered a smooth operation with smiling but efficient staff. The rooms are either modern or art deco, and fortunately we were upgraded into an art deco suite which was spectacular. It was not overly large or lavish, but a perfect mix of style, comfort and usability. There were no silly additional things like fancy light switches that also control the television etc.... instead there was a normal one, and a normal remote which everyone could use immediately. We enjoyed the large selection of music available for free on the TV and you can 'pipe' music through to the sitting room, or your bathroom which was fun. | If you get a suite then you are offered a butler who will do just about anything... we had our shoes polished, some clothes ironed, and she bought us a set of London monopoly too at our request - from the order we had it up in our room in just under one hour. | The American Bar is pretty trendy, although I prefer the Beaufort Bar with its very high ceiling and old fashioned style. Either one serve lovely cocktails as you'd expect - although expect to pay around £15 - £20. The River Restaurant is good, although perhaps not as good as it ought to be. I dined with friends and all our food was well presented and yummy, but none of us said we would return since it was about £85 a head... we would return to the Beaufort Bar however - great people watching! | In the morning we had a delicious breakfast in the room which was served piping hot and very quickly. Upon check-out I asked for a quick show-round and saw some of the smaller rooms, along with their amazing suites. I would absolutely definitely 100% only book an art deco room - although the modern rooms are ok, the difference is huge. I stay at hotels to experience something different from home... so why pay £1,000 to stay in a modern room which does not fit with the hotel, when you can stay in a traditional art deco room that fits with the whole atmosphere of the hotel and its service. | If you like London hotels, this is a classic which you ought to experience once... but if you can't afford to, then I'd suggest popping into the Beaufort Bar for a cocktail.",London,2/4/2012
The Dorchester,5,Top stay,"The Dorchester, | Maybe i have been extremely lucky but when looking for a hotel in London, close to the area where i had to attend a dinner, i came across 'The Dorchester'. | Having heard a lot about 'The Dorchester ', they happened to have a promotion in February and could book a single room at £200 (excl taxes, 15%), which for London standards is very, very good price for a hotel with that class. | The reception was rather cool, but the good news was that for one or the other reason i got 'an upgrade'. Frankly speaking when booking i thought i would get an overpriced,small, crampy London hotel room but all of a sudden i found myself in a very nice luxury top class room with marble bathroom. | During my stay i had nothing to complain and treated myself the next morning with an (overpriced) Englisk breakfast, but all in all a lovery experience. | Thanks Dorchester, a stay to remember...",Aartselaar,3/12/2008
The Rembrandt,5,"Location, room, and service outstanding","The location across from V&amp;A and near Kensington tube is outstanding. Ask for executive room as it and bathroom is large and spotless. Rm 649 offered a partial V&amp;A view, quiet, and nice big, comfy bed. Concierge, Pablo, was friendly, informative and extremely helpful. A description falls between a boutique hotel and a large hotel. All the romance of a boutique with the services of a grand hotel. Compared to others, it is a fantastic value when buffet breakfast is included. Staff at buffet greeted us with a smile every morning. We booked thru booking.com, then needed a change, emailed the hotel direct, hotel accommodated us graciously. Lovely staff.",NA,8/17/2015
Ridgemount Hotel,4,overnight stay,"Very very clean B+B, very helpful and informative staff. Easy walking distance of Covent Gardens. Small rooms and hard beds but en-suite adequate. Tea and coffee available from a machine downstairs.Great breakfast . Only downside is the busy main road at the front which our room overlooked. Perhaps a room at the back would cut out some of the noise but hey.....this is London, expect some hussle and noise!! Would definitely go back.",north yorkshire,5/7/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Another great stay!,"My 2nd visit was even lovelier than the first. Superior room with well stocked mini bar, and good facilities.

If we ever return to London, there is a 100% chance that we will try to stay at this hotel again! Our entire experience was exceptional, from the moment we walked in the doors to the moment we checked out. Every member of the hotel staff was friendly and helpful. We felt like family during our stay. The rooms themselves are clean and well-equipped with modern furnishings. I particularly enjoyed the shower with its combination of a rain shower head and removable sprayer! For a luxury hotel, the price for our stay was very affordable as well which was just an added bonus!","Indianapolis, Indiana",7/7/2017

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,The Mondrian is well worth a visit!,"We routinely stay at St Martins Lane and this was the first time we'd ventured the other side of the river and I have to say it was well worth it. The hotel was first class...we stayed in a River View Balcony suite with a view toward St Pauls Cathedral and it was clean, well maintained and extremely tasteful. It was my Fiancés birthday and the hotel left a handwritten note of congratulations and a bottle of fizz which was an especially nice touch. It was an excellent location for th Oxo Tower, which was the venue for the birthday meal, again a good choice. All in all I have to say....we shall be back!!","Swindon, United Kingdom",7/13/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,3,Very clean and very friendly though CS sub par.,"If I would to highlight the one best place about this hotel it is that it's far enough away from the main city to be very quiet. The front desk was very friendly and they are all wonderful. I wanted a mini-fridge and was not going to use the mini-bar so they just took out all the alcohol that minute so I could use the fridge. The one night they accidentally did restock the fridge front desk I wish I remembered her name came up right away to take it out and was very apologetic. The rooms are very clean and was restocked daily I even had a complaint about the noise because of the cleaning maids making to much noise to early (and it wasn't their fault the door stop just made a lot of noise) and they adjusted so they would clean that room later so we could sleep in. | The only downsides I could say would be the concierge and the hotel restaurant. In the restaurant you have to (well we had to at least) pay up front 30lbs per person for the meal which is not to pricey as it includes appetizer, main, and desert. I personally did not like anything for an appetizer and my girlfriend did not want desert so I asked if we had to order all 3 courses and could we take some off the tab if we ordered just the main or even replace them with sides (which are not included)? She told me that I could order one course but the price would not change and I wasn't going to pay that much for just one course with no sides at a hotel restaurant. | | On top of that DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH FOR RESTAURANTS! The concierge there was no help I mean he would call places that I found to make reservations for us, but he was just doing Google searches and came up with the same results I did in my room. I wanted to eat off the beaten path and every night he would say ""I do not know look at convent garden"". | (As a side note when we went to 3 cities in Italy every place would recommend places that they would go to eat and out of all the places we only had 1 bad place out of 2 weeks there.) It was very frustrating to find a place as we went during the holidays and every placed was packed. So after a full day (12+hrs) of site-seeing I would have to go back and do research on where to eat for the next day which I wish I really did not have to do.","Coventry, Rhode Island",2/1/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Fantastic small Curzon cinema,"I went to watch the latest Star Wars movie at The Mondrian on Boxing Day and it did not disappoint! Cosy, comfy, great seats with side tables for your drinks... it was like a private screening! The screen is not the biggest (but sitting in a small screening room does not require a big screen). This is a small cinema that packs a big punch. Great price too. Just a short walk along from Southbank... I will definitely be visiting again!","London, United Kingdom",1/24/2017
The Savoy,5,Very much a 5 star experience,"We treated ourselves to a night at the Savoy when poor planning on my part saw us booked to attend multiple events in central London on the same day. ""Treated"" is the perfect word for the experience. The room was beautiful, spotlessly clean, extremely quiet and had all the touches you'd expect from a 5* hotel (including a very welcome espresso maker &amp; fresh milk in the fridge). The bathroom was very spacious and well appointed. Staff at the Savoy are lovely - friendly, helpful and efficient. There are plenty of dining options in the hotel but we had little time to eat and so only had an opportunity to try a couple of the light bites from the (24 hour) in-room dining menu. Our food was delivered piping hot within 20 minutes of ordering which, in a hotel of this size, was an impressive feat! The chicken spring rolls and squid rings we chose were delicious. Of course staying at the Savoy isn't cheap but, if you're looking to spoil yourself and are lucky enough to be able to stay here, then I can't imagine you could ever be disappointed.","London, United Kingdom",2/26/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Great stay,"Loved this hotel, nothing to fault it at all, great rooms, nice quiet atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff and good location.

Rhodes Hotel,5,Great location and hotel,"We have stayed at the Rhodes Hotel 3 times, twice for shorter stays and in May 2012 for 28 days while we attended a music festival. We have been very pleased with the hotel experience each time and will definitely stay there again. The location close to Paddington station in excellent for the Heathrow express and also for access to several tube lines. The neighborhood is pleasant and quiet and close to a number of pubs and ethnic restaurants. It is also safe at night, important when attending evening performances. The hotel is well maintained with updated bathrooms and excellent air conditioning (it was in the 80's during part of our stay). The rooms are very clean and serviced daily. The breakfast provided is very tasty with ample portions and excellent service. Although the rooms are not large, the size is typical for a London hotel and they are well furnished and comfortable with good beds. Although also typical for London hotels of this type there is no elevator but staff were very helpful and carried our luggage up and down at arrival and departure. We particularly enjoyed our interactions with Mr. and Mrs. Crias the proprietors who were both friendly and very helpful as were all their staff.","Seattle, Washington, USA",6/6/2012
The Savoy,5,EXCELLENT ALL THE WAY AROUND,After some issues with my stay in 2015 I decided to give them another chance and am glad I did. Wonderful visit. They got everything perfect. Especially first rate was the check-in that took about a minute. From the time the black cab dropped me off to the suite door closing behind me took about 5 minutes. Was pleasantly surprised they put me in the newly remodeled Monet Suite (recently relocated from the fifth floor to a corner on the sixth - with views along The Thames from St. Paul's to Big Ben). Valet was very helpful and attentive - answering questions and giving useful tips. Well done Savoy!!!,Melbourne,3/26/2017
Ridgemount Hotel,5,"Clean, Clean, Clean","After a friend suggestion i booked at the ridgemount hotel and i found that the perfect choice! | The room big enought for 2 people and 1 extra bed ( even if we were 2 people) and very surpisingly: 1 complete bathroom. The breakfast was really nice and the location perfect. | But the best thing in Ridgemount hotel was the cleaniness of the rooms, unusual for the english standards. | I will return with no doubt! | And about the rewievs complainting about noise. I where in a room facing gower street and i slept like a baby... ( there's double windows, that looks new)","Prato, Italy",3/1/2010
Corinthia Hotel London,5,AMAZING!!,"Well.... What can I say... I'm Speechless! This hotel is one of the nicest places I have stayed! And I feel like I've stayed at all the top name brand resorts. The customer service is beyond anything that I've experienced! I used the concierge for pretty much everything... From our tour of London for a party of 12- was awesome!, to tea and all dinner reservations, the concierges even went out and purchased Easter baskets for my 3 children. Although we only stayed 4 nights.... We tried to experience as much of the hotel as possible... The spa was very nice and the pool for the kiddos was amazing, even if they do have certain hours that the kids can swim. The rooms were oversized with expresso machine in all the rooms and they were able to accomodate a connecting room for my kids. The bathrooms were great, with a decent size shower with great pressure from the rain head. | The hotel restaurant- North Hall was great... They even made my little boy a pizza even thou it wasn't on the menu. I honestly don't have one complaint or suggestion for this hotel (which is a first)... I now know why Mariah Carey was staying at the hotel, because it's the best! So if its good enough for Mariah, it's good enough for me! :)","Denver, CO.",4/4/2016

The Dorchester,5,After theatre drinks,"Every city has a bar that is a 'must visit', when in London that is The Dorchester. | Old world charm combined with knowledgeable well trained staff makes the experience just that, an experience rather than just having a few cocktails. | Oysters and champagne is one experience, sitting at a well-stocked bar having a chat with the South American/Italian bar tender in these surroundings makes you feel 'at home'. | Every eye to detail is taken care off but you are not suffocated by over servicing. There is a fine line that never seems to be crossed that makes the experience more memorable. | Yes, you are spoiled for choice in London, but having tried many upmarket locations that I decided not to even review, The Dochester is the location of choice whenever we are in London. | |","Castle Forbes Bay, Australia",5/28/2017
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,A comforting experience,"The front desk staff are top notch. Very friendly and helpful especially after an overnight flight from NY to London with no sleep. When I entered my room, I expected a sterile, generic room like other hotels I have stayed in. What I received was a comforting and relaxing residence with personality. My room was always restored to it's original state by the time I got back from the office. It felt just like mom cleaning up after me. The rubber duck is a great touch, look out for my pictures of The Donald and myself (my daughter named him when I returned home). Similar to the front desk, the bar staff were spectacular. I could tell the hotel staff were happy with their work. The location is perfectly situated within a 5-10 minute walk either to the office or other local shops. A big heartfelt thank you to the staff at the Apex London Wall for making me feel like a welcomed guest in their beautiful city.",NA,10/7/2015

It really made the beginning of the seasons festivities get off to a great start I hope the chef received my complements. You are truly an artist. Thank you from all of us. So glad Simon you booked this. A Christmas meal to remember. I am definitely going to visit again &amp; am going to treat myself to your twilight spa too. It looked heavenly.

Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Perfect hotel!,"Stayed here over August bank holiday weekend for my birthday. We had a suite with balcony. The room was lovely, spacious and immaculately clean. The staff were friendly and so welcoming, it was my birthday and they left me a card and chocolates as well as rose petals on our bed - a nice touch :) we stayed here to be close to Jamie Oliver's Fifteen, the area has quite a businessy feel and there's not much open at the weekend, but the hotel is really close to the tube so still a convenient base. I would definitely recommend and would return if I'm ever in the area again. Thank you!",NA,9/19/2014

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Outstanding.,"This is a modern stylish hotel that is brilliantly situated, with wonderfully appointed rooms, a great restaurant and great bar, and fantastic service. | Situated at the southern end of Blackfriars Bridge in the old Sea Containers position, it is in a great location to walk along (in either direction) the totally renewed and upgraded South Bank with its many bars and restaurants. A short walk over the bridge and you reach the St Pauls Cathedral area (and there are great views of St Pauls, especially at night). | The rooms are extremely well appointed, with a mini bar and crystal glasses that is 10/10. The walk in showers are also beautifully appointed. | Although the bar is a different concession it is trendy and chic, popular with the after-work crowd.","Zurich, Switzerland",1/1/2016
The Rembrandt,5,Great time in London and The Rembrandt,"Just returned from a trip to London with my son to celebrate his 10th birthday. Stayed in the Rembrandt principally due to its proximity to the Science and Natural History Museums and its convenience to the tubes and bus routes. It was a great choice. Lovely room. I think they may have upgraded us as there was a good size sitting area. Great bathroom with a jacuzzi bath which my son loved. Beds were very comfortable with matress toppers and good quality linens. The hotel in general was spotless throughout and the facilities of an excellent standard. | Its directly opposite the V&amp;A and five minutes walk to both the Science and Nat History museums. Nearet tube station, South Kensington was a 10 minute stroll and there's a bus stop outside which takes you to Harrods. For our purposes it could not have been more cenvenient. | Staff were generally very helpful, particularly the concierge desk. However there was one receptionist who was generally officious and came across as a bit unfriendly. I noticed that this was not just towards me but also other guests. It didn't detract from the visit however. | One problem however was the temperature of the room. The aircon whilst effective needed to be on full blast and this was s bit noisy. We were also on the 1st floor and close to the kitchen vents so the room often smelt of cooking. It wasn't over powering or particularly unpleasant but it meant you couldn't really open the windows to get fresh air. | The breakfast was good although very busy, with plenty of choice. | Free wired internet access in the rooms and wireless in the reception and bar areas was very welcome. Two computers in the lobby had free internet access so even if you dont have a laptop or smart phone with you you can still get online. | Also very convenient to a great selection of restaurants catering to all tastes and budgets. Superb Chinese restaurant (The Good Earth) 5 minutes up the road was fantastic. I have travelled in China a fair bit and this was one of the best Chinese meals I have ever had! | All in all a very pleasant stay at the Rembrandt and would stay again and recommend this hotel.",dunadry,8/24/2010
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",3,Camera piccolissima !,"Ho prenotato una Classic Double Room per tre notti. La posizione dell'hotel è molto buona, a pochi minuti dalle stazioni metro di Gloucester Road ed Earl's Court. La struttura è nuovissima e molto bella. Il personale è molto accogliente. La camera 307 era piccolissima, il letto è 140x180 ed io sono alto 190 ! Niente da dire sul design, la pulizia, il tablet, l'Occitaine etc. etc., ma non si riusciva nemmeno a spostare la sedia, nell'armadietto si possono solo appendere le camicie, nell'unico ripiano c'è il servizio da teiera, idem per il bagno, nessun ripiano, ho dovuto mettere beauty nella cassaforte. Manca il frigo bar, che poteva essere utile per mettevi la biancheria. Mi sono molto sorpreso della scarsa insonorizzazione della camera, essendo stato appena ristrutturato, il rumore che proviene da Cromwell Rd. è veramente notevole anche al terzo piano.","Dolo, Italy",3/29/2014
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,3,I don't get it,"This hotel is good, but I couldn't find anything special about it at all. It lacked charm, the personal touch and any feature that would make me remember it. Yes it is shiny and new, high tech things in the rooms, tastefully decorated, but for the price it should be. I found the whole place quite 'masculine' in its decor, especially the rooms and downstair bar. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it just didn't feel welcoming to me. I had a room over Park Lane, with a 'balcony' that if you stood on tiptoes or bent right down you could see the park. Quite small in size and could have done without having a desk squashed into the corner. | I dined in the restaurant CUT and that was an even bigger mystery to me after hearing people rave about it. Odd service, we got asked to move tables after they'd already brought us bread and water, the sommelier took forever to come and then disappeared, we had two or three different waiters through the course of dinner, the v expensive wagyu beef was nice, but definitely not the best steak in London. It is only memorable to me because I was expecting something amazing and didn't get it. | The staff were ok, but not in a stand out way, more I didn't really notice them and they didn't enhance the stay rather than do anything wrong. | I don't want to sound overly negative because there is nothing really bad with this hotel, but for the money it was underwhelming and there are many other places I would pick in London over this one.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom",11/4/2013
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",5,The Wellesley Hotel,"We checked into your hotel in June for a 7 night stay, nothing was too much trouble, the room was immaculate and comfortable, great bathroom and tv in the bath was a lovely added extra. | Keith the driver was so polite and a good conversationalist, You cannot beat the Butler service which is 24 hours per day. Gary the butler was one of the best, he even brought flowers to our room when we had received bad news from home and also steamed a dress i needed for dinner and it was returned within twenty minutes, his service was professional but never over-bearing. | You must stay in this location if you have never been to London before as it's just perfect.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Great vibe! Poor food!,"The marking is for the location, rooms, amenities, service, people, all of which are above par but their breakfast is unimaginative and poor. A sparce menu punctuated with a lack of imaginative food kills the experience. They served the exact same menu down to the type of Danish on the 3 straight days we were there. | For the price one expects a wholesome breakfast. | So if the most important meal of the day is not important than i recommend the mondrian","Mumbai, India",11/20/2014
The Savoy,3,Not value for money and quite frankly a huge dissapointment!!,"After saving very hard; I wanted to treat my Mum to a ""once in a lifetime"" experience; at The Savoy. We didn't really want to go in for the formal dining areas, so we opted for a more casual dining experience in the ""Thames Foyer"". After being seated we were given the menus; I opted for the ""Grilled Scottish beef sirloin with chunky chips and béarnaise sauce"" and my mum the: ""Grilled beef fillet burger with bacon, English cheddar and caramelized onion mayonnaise served with chunky chips"". We enjoyed the setting while we waited in anticipation for our main courses. When they arrived it looked quite simply like pub grub. Now I understand that we werent in the main dining restaurants and we werent expecting fine dining quality food; but for the price we were paying. We quite simply expected more for our money; especially as The Savoy has got a ""supposedly"" exceptional reputation. The main courses tasted average (the chips were slightly undercooked though) and personally I have tasted better (and for a third of the price) at my local pub. We were served by number of different waiters; which seemed quite unprofessional: as if we were an inconvenience to them. It almost seemed as if they needed more direction and communication into their specific roles. The main courses took a while to be cleared; almost as if theyd forgotten us. For dessert I had the Crispy Valrhona chocolate and praline torte with Tonka bean ice cream and my mum the caramel hazelnut tiramisu. They were presented in quite an old fashioned way. The chocolate and praline tart tasted wonderful; it had a balance of textures; the sweetness of the praline was balanced out nicely by the bitter chocolate and Tonka bean ice-cream. However the tiramisu wasnt as impressive; the base was soggy (when I think it should have been a crisp base) and the dish was lacking in flavours and different textures. After we had finished our desserts; we felt as if we were being forced out, as the bill was placed in front of us, without us even asking for it. Overall I think the setting of the Savoy was amazing and since the refurbishment the décor and features are stunning; but on the other hand I felt as if the staff were very judgmental into whom they gave special treatment too. Since being in the hospitality industry myself I think its upsetting that the staff seemed to look down at the average person; who just wanted a special treat and paid over the odds to receive a disappointing experience. I feel that the hotel should take more pride in all of their paying customers and not just the chosen few; after all we are all paying the same price and this experience has seriously affected my views on the reputation of the hotel and what it has to offer.","Crewkerne, United Kingdom",10/28/2012
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,business hotel in the city,"very well situated , although if you arrive on Sunday evening this area is very quite/deserted. Very good hotel and a good service provided.

The Savoy,5,Amazing,"Stayed at the Savoy for my wedding anniversary, from start to finish the experience was amazing. I have stayed in some amazing hotels all around the world and I can be hard to please, but the level of detail at the Savoy is off the scale. Every member of staff knows your name (even ones that havent served you) the rooms are as you would expect for a 5 star, big,clean just right. They offer a text service where you can text your request anytime of day! trust me this is the best thing I have ever come across!!! From ice in my room to book me a table at a club to ask for my car to be ready at checkout!! Seriously I cannot emphasis enough how good this service is. Yes its not cheap to stay there but if you can afford to stay in London dont wast your time &amp; money at the other hotels stay at the Savoy!! | Well dont Savoy you have it right...",NA,5/27/2018

Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Fantastic hotel,"This is a great hotel in a good location. From Heathrow you take the Piccadilly line (blue) to Holburn and then change onto the Central line (red) and get off at either Bank or Liverpool street station. Liverpool Street station also does trains to Stansted. | Located in the Financial district this means that the area is quiet during the weekend which is perfect as there was no noise from the street to disrupt your sleep. Our room was on the first floor and we couldnt hear anything. The room did look out onto an office block, this didnt matter as there was no-one there during the weekend. Not sure whether this would be an issue for some during the week. There are net and full curtains though. | Didnt encounter much staff throughout our 2 night stay but those we did were friendly, pleasant and efficient. The hotel itself is a boutique hotel and would be reminisce of the W hotel chain in the US which I like. | We had the standard King room and it was very roomy. The bed &amp; pillows were very comfortable but there didnt seem to be enough duvet, it seemed to be the size of the mattress without having any hangover. This was OK as the room was warm enough and we didnt need the duvet for heat. The decor in the room was very modern with greens, blues and browns and the throw, cushions and curtains all matched. I loved the Chaise Long at the end of the bed as it meant that when you want to relax and watch tv you had something other then the bed to sit on. We didnt use the other extras in the room such as the free local calls or the Mp3 docking station, but they were there if we need to. There is a gym available but we never got the time to see it. | The bathroom was lovely, bright with a large mirror. The bath was a good size and had the taps in the middle. The shower was a lovely big separate shower with a rain shower head which was great. Hairdryer is provided along with mini body lotion, shampoo, shower gel bottles. | We didnt have any meals at the hotel so we cant comment on the food. As you are in the financial district which shuts down a bit at the weekend there is a limited amount open for to grab breakfast so it might be just as easy to eat in the hotel. For dinner there is a Pizza Express close by and pubs as you make your way towards Liverpool Street and London Wall. There is a Tesco Metro a couple of minutes from Liverpool street station. | All in all I would recommend this hotel and would definitely return",Belfast -Northern Ireland,11/21/2011

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Dinner for three,"Excellent dinner and service, which made the money spent for it totally worth it. The Imburrata was awesome and made me forget for a moment of being away from Italy. The salmon was perfectly cooked and dressed and I also advise the sea bass, but for no more than two people. Impeccable service was provided by both Fortunato and Alberto, thing which we all know is getting always more and more rare to find in London. | Check out the bar at the top of the hotel for a drink with an amazing view all over the Thames and St Paul's. | I'll be back for sure.",NA,4/26/2015

Don't expect anything. The location is noisy, there is not even shower gel in the showers. The breakfast was the worst we had in the 3 weeks trip and there was no alternative to choose from.

Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Good service and an enjoyable stay,"The Apex London Wall Hotel provided a very comfortable room (but without a view). After a slight queue, the breakfast table service was excellent and the food included freshly baked pastries. The complimentary drinks at the bar were appreciated. The room mini-bar was lacking a few items and had not been cleaned out (someone had left something which was starting to go off!).

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",4,"Snooty Doormen, Small Rooms but unmistakingly Mandarin","We stayed at the London Mandarin Oriental which is located right on Hyde Park facing Harvey Nichols. Theres no better location if you need the triple endorsement of a good address, period real estate and a plethora of luxury brands. Youre surrounded by high culture (the V&amp;A is a mere stroll away), high prices and a heightened sense of privileged entitlement. This might account for the slight snootiness of the doormen at MO but once you run their gauntlet, the supreme aesthetics of the interiors are calming and reassuring. Our guest room was courtyard-facing, small and dark but thats not uncommon in cities like London. The MO experience was evident by the regularly refreshed fresh fruit, the his and her slippers and the genius whimsical touch of a fan shaped bookmark discreetly placed in your book on the night stand. - See more at: http://padraicino.com/2014/02/14/48-hours-london-beyond-tourist-trails/#sthash.4zJkufpn.dpuf","Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",2/19/2014

From visiting the hotel to plan our day up until we checked out the staff were superb. We were married in the Pavillion and Penthouse room on the 8th floor overlooking the city and had an amazing day. | We had a suite overlooking Mayfair and on arrival were given a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries which we enjoyed in the mammoth bath. After our wedding we returned to the room to find more strawberries and a lovely card from the hotel manager congratulating us on our wedding. | We ordered breakfast in bed and the amount of food that was delivered was brilliant. We ate in the room and the server set up the table and came back later to collect the dishes.

Das Hotel liegt im Business-Bereich, dadurch sehr ruhig, trotzdem nur ein paar Gehminuten von den Sehenswürdigkeiten, Themse und Shoppingstrassen entfernt. Ein Ruhepol in dieser attraktiven und touristischen Stadt. Sehr empfehlenswert.",NA,4/27/2017
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,"Great location, fantastic staff","A great location, close to Trafalgar Square and Temple church. a block from the Thames and central to just about anything you would want to see in London. Great rooms and services and a staff that really welcomes you.","Eugene, Oregon",2/22/2016
London Guest House,4,The best you'll find for the price!,"Our first impression of the hotel was that it was incredibly tiny, but because we didn't stay in the room at all during the day (and what tourist would) this didn't affect us at all. The facilities were immaculately clean and the staff was incredibly friendly and extremely helpful. The included continental breakfast was quite basic but at the same time, was a great start to the day. There is a London tube station (Acton Town) about 15mins away which is a lengthy walk particularly during the evening hours. However, a 5 pound cab ride should get you to the hotel in no time. There was road works outside our room at the time we were here which were loud and made it hard to sleep but they'll be long done by the time anyone who reads this will book a stay.Unfortunately we prematurely checked out and are incredibly depressed as we cannot find anything better for the price. I'm currently writing this in the devonshire arms pub in Picadilly Circus after booking a crap hole of a hostel and wishing I had booked more nights at the London guest house. Do you're self a favour and book this hotel because the money you save being here will make your holiday that much better. Good luck!","Adelaide, Australia",6/19/2011
The Savoy,5,Short stay,A fantastic stay at The Savoy. The first time I have stayed at the hotel and it did not disappoint. Service was exemplary and the food was wonderful with a perfect balance. | Finally the American bar experience should not be missed and Eric created some fantastic cocktails to end the night.,NA,10/20/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Very good on all aspects,"Although we arrived comfortably after check-in time we were initially disappointed that the receptionist wasn't sure if the room was ready; we decided to wait in the bar and we didn't wait long as within 5 minutes they had come to find us with our keys and an assurance that everything was ready for us. | The room was incredibly comfortable with a well appointed bathroom and a fantastic view out over the river. We had drinks sent up through room service, which arrived promptly. | We also tried the Rumpus room later that evening and even though we were late for our booked slot they managed to arrange for us to still have a table - the bar had a great atmosphere, excellent drinks and reasonably attentive service. | We both really enjoyed the breakfast - although as with many high-end hotels it is very expensive. Over all we had a great time here and would happily recommend it.","London, United Kingdom",1/18/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,lovely hotel,"From the moment we checked in to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. | The staff were friendly and couldn't do enough for you, the room was model and funky. The cocktails were exceptional, the room service was fast and extremely tasty. | A great stay","Ipswich, United Kingdom",5/10/2015
Rhodes Hotel,5,Fantastico hotel!,"Posizione ottimale, l'hotel è situato a meno di 2 minuti a piedi dalla metro!Le camere sono molto pulite e accoglienti!Il personale è molto cortese e pronto ad aiutare per qualsiasi eventuale problema!Ci tornerò sicuramente!",NA,2/6/2015
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Loved the Ridgemount Hotel,"I checked so many Bed &amp; Breakfast sites it was ridiculous, I started going straight to the reviews and they were all pretty mediocre. Then I found the Ridgemount! | It was such a pleasure staying there. The family and staff were wonderful. When I injured myself and ended up in a cast they helped me in every way, they changed my room and brought my belongings down for me, even brought breakfast to my room for me. | The hotel was clean, the staff friendly and polite. Excellent location, quiet and the breakfast was delicious. I can't say enough, I will definately stay there again.",Connecticut,3/14/2010
The Lanesborough,5,The feel of real luxury in the heart of London,"I have to admit that I was very skeptical about staying at the newly re-opened Lanesborough hotel - mainly because I am usually trying to avoid hotels that remind me of museums or palaces, and try to go for something more contemporary or even futuristic. On top of that, it seemed like the pictures on the web-site didn't really do justice to the hotel and made it look more like a museum than an appealing place to stay. | However, upon arriving to the hotel and checking-in, my perception has gone into a completely different direction - the hotel does offer a truly luxurious experience with the exceptional staff that make you feel like a royalty. All the rooms are superb, exquisitely designed and are quite spacious. | The overall atmosphere is the one of an expensive and lush British country house, and that is such a unique feel for those who decide to stay on a Park Lane - the Lanesborough truly does stand out among other 5-star hotels by offering a one of a kind accommodation. | Amongst other positives, I definitely would point the great welcome amenities in the room upon arrival including a bottle of champagne and fresh fruit basket, the best cosmetics line there is out there that is provided in all room categories - of a highest quality, the free wi-fi internet, and amazingly decorated public areas, as well as the open-air cigar room for all the cigar lovers. | The hotel offers different styles on all 4 floors, the 4th being the lightest and brightest and probably most suitable for a younger crowd. | The only negative throughout the whole stay was the false fire alarm that started at 8am and the staff couldn't turn it down for about 30 minutes - but hopefully that was a one-time thing and only happened because the hotel is not fully opened yet and there are still some repairs and renovations going on in certain areas of the hotel. | For those looking for the unique luxurious experience of a traditional, yet royal, British accommodation, the Lanesborough is definitely the place to go to.","Moscow, Russia",7/27/2015
The Savoy,4,Teething problems?,"I stayed at The Savoy with my 19 year old daughter for the first time since the renovations. I will sum up my stay as being 'unfortunate' When I arrived there was no one to meet and greet me so I went inside and found that reception had been moved from it's original location, I wandered around and found a queue of people who were waiting to get into the American bar for a drink? I eventually found the room where you could check in and was told my room was not ready. I left my bag and went out and returned at 3pm to find that there still wasn't a room for me (I had requested a twin room in a quiet location) I explained that I needed to take some pain killers for my bad back and I was given a glass of water which went on the bill, a little bit mean I thought. When my room was ready I noticed I had been given a room with road works outside so they moved us without any fuss. Room 2 was a nice big room with a hideous view but my daughter and I decided not to complain, that is until I realised we were next to the lift shaft and unable to sleep. We were moved again on the following day to a smaller room which was quiet, that is until the 'RAVE' in the next room started at 3am. So 2 nights without any sleep! Security did move the people out promptly. | The things we did like about our stay were the lovely staff who looked after us and were very polite inspite of my rantings, the decor, the bathroom and the food. We did not like being told that we cannot have a drink in the bar unless we joined the queue I did ask the concierege to see if we could bypass as we were guests &amp; I could not stand due to my back problem but alas no. | I stay in London for business on a regular basis mostly at The Carlton Tower or the Grosvenor hotel but I will be returning to The Savoy in January with my husband this time. I have been promised it will be perfect and I hope it will be.","Brentford, United Kingdom",12/15/2010
The Dorchester,5,Simply Outstanding,"We frequently visit London for short breaks and we like to stay at different hotels each time. Service is extremely important to us and at The Dorchester, we get the best possible service from each member of staff. Good job and thank you guys!","Bristol, United Kingdom",2/22/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Great hotel top location and quality experience,"This hotel is conveniently situated on the south bank near Blackfriars bridge and the OXO tower. Very modern, clean spacious rooms. We stayed two nights and had breakfast which was excellent quality and choice. Used the roof top bar which was impressive | Would recommend and will stay there again when in London","Northampton, United Kingdom",2/4/2018
The Rembrandt,4,We are going back,"My wife and I stayed at the Rembrandt in August 2002 for four nights. The location is superb, across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum, very close to Harrods, Buckingham Palace, and tube stops. | The rooms are nicely done, older, but well cared for. The staff is very attentive, and the breakfasts are great in a very comfortable dining room. | We are going back in September for four more nights. Highly recommended.","Visalia, California",7/20/2004
The Savoy,5,"A Fairmont Hotels ""Treasure"" in London exactly where you want to be","Having experience with other Fairmont properties, we expected a good stay....what we got was a 'great' stay. | From our first contact with Matt Williams and Hannah Roebuck to the car/driver that greeted us at the airport, to the little requests we made during our week stay, this Fairmont, proved to be one of the best. We had hoped to have a room with a view...and had requested same, but that aside, all else was terrific. As with real estate (location location location)...5 star hotels is about (service service service). This is an exceptional hotel, an excellently located oasis in a busy city and well worth the cost. Invest your money with the best, the returns are double digit !","Orlando, Florida",8/16/2013
The Savoy,5,The lap of luxury,"We were supposed to be staying at the St James Sofitel, which I'm sure would have been a great hotel, but due to an error on the travel agent's part, we were upgraded to a room at The Savoy. And what an upgrade! Pulling in off the Strand in our taxi you can tell it's going to be a luxurious stay, as the doormen take your bags and you are welcomed by a member of staff who takes you straight to your room to check in. Everything about this place is beautiful, even the lifts! There are amazing paintings, vases and old style telephones at every turn in the corridors and our Edwardian room (523) was no less stylish. We had a very comfy king size bed and a view over the courtyard and a large bathroom with a bath and rain shower. The toiletries are Le Labo and smell divine, and the mini bar is the best stocked bar I've ever seen in a hotel with Ruinart champagne and Charbonnel and Walker chocolates! The first night we had dinner next door at Simpsons-in-the-Strand but were ready for breakfast the next morning. | We went down to the Thames Foyer, a stunning setting for breakfast, and although service was slow (we think they forgot our order the first time round), the food was great, with lots to choose from. We were in no rush, so this wasn't a problem, and we enjoyed being waited on and feeling like royalty. All the staff are so friendly and helpful. | Before dinner we enjoyed a cocktail in the American bar, which, although not cheap, is a fun place to drink. The next day, we managed to get a table for afternoon tea, again in the Thames Foyer. I would advise a light breakfast and certainly no lunch if you do this, as there is a LOT of delicious food here, worth the stay alone to experience this. They even served a version of Will and Kate's chocolate wedding cake, yum! They will also replenish anything you want more of. That evening was spent in the Beaufort bar, exquisitely decorated in a black and gold deco theme, the singer even complimented me on my dress! Everything about this place makes you feel special, which is what a holiday should be about. The drinks are not cheap, but despite having 5 or 6 champagne cocktails, there were no hangovers the next day, so they clearly use the good stuff! | One morning, we took breakfast in our room, and this was delivered not just on a tray, but a proper table was brought up to our room, complete with a warming oven for our toast and pancakes. It was just as good as the breakfast in the foyer, which cannot always be said for room service. | If I could afford it, I would make a stay here a regular thing!","Guernsey, Channel Islands",11/4/2012
The Rembrandt,4,Very nice hotel! Great location!,"Lovely little hotel in a centrally located area. The hotel staff were very pleasant, although unable to accommodate the early .check in I had selected two days from an email the hotel SENT ME. The rooms were nice, clean and (for London) spacious. I have a universal gripe with all the hotels I've stayed in lately ... there isn't a top sheets or washcloth in hotel rooms anymore. I get too hot with a duvet but like to have a sheet thrown over me while I sleep. This is not specific to this hotel, I've experienced this everywhere. The only downside to this particular hotel was the breakfast included with the room rate was awful. The only good thing on the breakfast buffet was the sausage and the croissants. My son who will darn near eat anything didn't want to eat there. Overall, we were happy we stayed here.","Seattle, WA",8/9/2014
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",4,Worth the price you pay,"We stayed 3 nights visiting London. I know this hotel is expensive, but it its worth it. The level of service at every position is at the highest standard. They use your name and make you feel special. The housekeeping crew does the little things that make it unbelievable - leave individual water for every person in the room with slippers and robes. Fresh fruit is kept filled in the bowl along with bottled apple juice. Your toiletries are neatly organized on top of linen. The ""Dinner"" restaurant is a wonderful experience and a must visit for anyone going to UK. The location of this hotel is walking distance to everything, best of all, a block away from Harrods. The only disappointment is for the price, you would expect WiFi to be free, but they do have a free computer room. I would recommend this hotel for the traveler who wants to feel special and expect high standards in a hotel.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",8/14/2011

The Dorchester,5,My favourite hotel in London,"If you want five star service and old fashioned British glamour you won't go far wrong here. Rooms are a decent size for London, bathrooms are huge, elegantly appointed with fabulous full sized Floris toiletries. Ok it could all do with a little updating and i wasn't a fan of the cigarette smoke smell in the hallways but the service more than made up for these little issues. You are made to feel like a queen the minute you step inside, service is impeccable, they can even organise paying your congestion charge for you, a service i imagine is invaluable to foreign visitors who might be somewhat baffled by this ridiculous road tax. Best of all it is home to my favourite restaurant in London - Alain Ducasse - well worthy of it's three Michelin stars for the dessert trolly alone.","London, United Kingdom",12/26/2010
The Savoy,5,Classy,"The Savoy oozes class. It has the name, the location and the staff. And since its expensive renovation, it has the quality of room as well. If you want afternoon tea, you can't do better; the lemon curd is out of this world. | The only negative is the lack of a second easy chair in the bedroom (and the price). But on the latter point, you get what you pay for.","Surrey, United Kingdom",3/1/2015
The Savoy,2,"Not impressed by the hotel nor the steely eyed, unfavourable staff -","My first - and definitely last - stay at The Savoy. I understand that the hotel was completely overhauled in 2010 - and hats off to them for that; an accomplishment no doubt. However, I was simply not impressed - not even slightly. The rooms were so-so, the gym average and the (overpriced) food nothing to write home about. But thats OK  I am a seasoned traveler and can deal with that. However, I think the thing that put me off was the staff located in the lobby. Every one of them seemed distant, cold, and detached - not very friendly and seldom smiled  they were very zombie like. Although, truth be told, the doorman out front who hailed the cab for me each morning was awesome! Full of character and bounce - he always greeted me with a big warm smile, made it a point to chat with me while I waited for the cab, and then wished me a good day. This totally made for a great start to the day; I actually looked forward to my cab ride each day, but dreaded having to walk across the lobby in order to get to the front door. =( For the record, if I could have commando rolled from the lift to the front door I would have gladly done so in order not to have to endure the condescending sneers of the staff in the lobby. Heck, I routinely walked right past one of the female greeters two days in a row and not once did she ever smile and say good morning to me - not once. I understand The Savoy history and what not, and it is indeed conveniently located in the theater district, but the lobby staff - put quite bluntly - flat out sucked. I will never stay here again unless by accident - or forced to. Actually, in hindsight, The Holiday Inn Express at the airport probably would have been a better and friendlier choice.","Hong Kong, China",3/24/2012
The Savoy,2,I can't go back,"Pre the rebuild it was possibly the best hotel in London then it was sold with the change in management so the affability and warmth evaporated. Now its brash, in your face and the expected subtleties previously attributed to it are long gone. | Nothing appeals and its a place you may go to the once now but see no reason to return. Its turned into a trashy Russo-Arab glitzy and not worth the cost of the evening. In short they have successfully killed a once great hotel",WAPPING LONDON,11/9/2015
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Always Welcoming,"We've been staying at the Ridgemount for more than 25 years. The owners are very kind and hospitable. The rooms are clean and adequate. Staff is friendly and the full breakfast will keep you going all day. The location is terrific. Great Hotel, nice people. | Many Americans have recently found the Ridgemount. Groups of American girls have a habit of coming to breakfast barefoot and or in their pajamas. Some even put their bare feet up on the chairs in the dining room. Ladies please try to understand, you are not at home, the hotels public space is not your personal space. Dont be rude, put on some shoes and dress like an adult. We came down to the lobby one morning to find our path from the stairs blocked. An American girl was doing her yoga at the base of the stairs on the floor of the public lobby. She looked at us like we were supposed to find a way around her sweaty sprawl in consideration of her higher transcendent calling. So rude and thoughtless. Memo to American girls, either learn how to behave in public or stay home.","Sausalito, CA",7/1/2014
The Rembrandt,5,Another stay at The Rembrandt,"This was our latest of several visits to The Rembrandt. As before we found the staff both friendly and helpful, with the public areas and our room well appointed and spotlessly clean.

The Rembrandt,1,Cupboard room - not happy,"I stayed here in the idea of being close to the shops and museums etc. | Me and my partner wanted a little luxury &amp; found this hotel on offer. | We made our way to our room &amp; opened up, i was really annoyed as the size was very small. I am not the sort that gets annoyed with the size but we could have stayed in our usual hotel for a cheaper price. I made a complaint but this did not go any further.",United Kingdom,11/2/2011
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Trip to Albert Hall,"Hotel was excellent, staff very friendly and attentive, taxi to Albert Hall was £6 so good value, 10 minute walk from tube station and right next to a Sainsbury's. | Got a deal from voyageprive which included breakfast for us both (normally £25 each!), so worth shopping around for deals. | Hotel has been recently refurbished so everything is new and shiny. Would definitely recommend giving the Xenia a go.","Birmingham, United Kingdom",10/30/2013

The Savoy,4,Reasonable. Enjoyed a few nights in the larger suites.,"Had a reasonable experience staying for a couple of nights in between Christmas 2012 and New Year. Stayed in room 558 which is a one bedroom suite. | Good points: | 1) The room size - But then you are paying for it.. | 2) Luxury finish to the entire building. | 3) Swimming pool. | Could do better: | 1) Sofa very hard and uncomfortable in living room. | 2) TV up very high on the wall in living room | 3) Butler service bit of a gimmick * | 4) Not overly child friendly. Not allowed in bar areas. | 5) Breakfast not included in room rate. Its an extra £30pp per day | 6) Tiny ""half"" bath. Even in a larger suite. | 7) Logistically difficult to get to from tube station with luggage. You will need a cab. | 8) Swimming pool 1.2m in all directions so not for young kids. | 9) Kids beds just basic camp beds. And crammed into the room. No thought design wise to room layouts when roll out beds are in there. Just jammed in. | Overall it was a pleasant (but not a WOW) experience. Probably if you come as a couple its great but with a 3yr old its not really suitable. | * Butler service: You are informed on the website that you get your own ""Personal Butler"" but its not really true because its actually lots of different people (we had three) A guy called Francies, then a lady in the morning then a younger guy the next evening. They bring you coffee and I paid £30 to have a shirt ironed but other than that they dont ""do"" anything really. I unpacked my own case. Packed it myself. Cleaned my own shoes. So I do not think they added anything to the experience. When I did call butler to book a restaurant I was told to call concierge. I am sure if you are spending big cash they are useful. Maybe they were being discrete. And I am thinking I haven't seen them!",LONDON,12/29/2012
The Dorchester,5,Superb stay. Perfect hotel,"This hotel was excellent. Our stay was superb. The staff were exceptional, everyone of them very friendly and polite. The room was amazing and on checking in we were upgraded. | Afternoon Tea in the promenade was an experience i will never forget. If you are looking for a luxury hotel in London i believe the Dorchester is at the top. Thank you for such a fantastic stay. We will be back.",kent,11/25/2012
The Savoy,5,Second time and things are getting good...,"As a long time Savoy fan I booked for a night as was in London late with work. Decided it had to be river facing so booked the room with river views. Had 'the Savoy welcome'....ie I was asked if 'I was in residence' and then by means of various muffled noises welcomed by name inside! It is impressive and does make you feel that you have arrived! Was walked to my room and realised I wasn't near the Thames but found I had been upgraded to a junior suite......art deco and very lovely with wonderful bathroom and separate shower stall. And as pervious reviewers have said it was absolutely spotless. In fact so much so, you did wonder if anyone had ever been there before? All credit to housekeeping. Room was good but I did miss the river view....did I mention anything....no typical Brit. Had room service which was good......and then breakfast at Kaspar's. Last time it was the most disappointing element of the stay by far and certainly not worthy of a 5* hotel....this time it was superlative...food quality wonderful and service amazing....really magic. Was really impressive to watch and friendly at every point I now want to go back and be in suite facing the river.",London,2/24/2014
The Savoy,4,An experience!,"To stay at the Savoy is to experience style, tradition and history dating back to 1889. | Stepping through the doors one can only imagine the scenes in those early days. | But it was April, 2012 so how was the experience? Greeted at the door by the man in the fine coat and tall hat he suggested that he could look after our luggage and magically transport it to our hotel room. I didnt argue. | Now de-luggaged (I know its not a word but it sounds good) we walked into the foyer to be greeted by a man in a fine suit, cufflinks and a curly cable attached to his ear. Please follow me this way. Hypnotised by the whole Savoy experience I followed. We walked from the grand foyer into a small side room with open fireplace and exquisite Edwardian desks (I dont know if they were Edwardian but they looked the part). The walls were adorned with beautiful paintings and the whole Savoy experience was beginning to dawn on me. We sat at a desk and I realised this was a personal one-on-one check in  now theres style. | We had booked a normal double room but during the check-in procedure I heard the word upgrade. His introduction to the hotel became white noise as my brain kept banging the word upgrade around in my head like a metal ball in a pin-ball machine. | We walked from this delightful room to the lifts. Small but stylish the lift whisked us to the top floor. The doors opened and we were greeted by a man adorned in another beautiful suit  they love their suits at the Savoy. He smiled and introduced himself as the butler for our suite. Doh!! Now I had three words floating around in my head: upgrade, suite and butler. The walk from the lifts to the hotel room felt more like we were floating on some magical cloud as these three words formed images in my head of what lay behind the door. | Enroute another man appeared with our luggage  this is Harry Potter stuff!! | The butler opened the door and as if in slow motion we glided through the suite. First, the tiled chequered hallway with bronze statuette, into the living room with a selection of magazines, fine wines and whiskies. Onto the bathroom with 1920s art deco and finally into the bedroom overlooking the River Thames and Waterloo Bridge. | The butler left and I stopped for a moment to take it all in. I was at The SAVOY! | The surprise didnt stop there. Whilst having another recce through the suite I came across personalised stationary! Yes! Savoy stationary with my name on it! I wanted to write letters to the whole world! | That is the SAVOY experience. | Now, The Savoy is run by humans and whenever humans are involved, mistakes will be made and I have to say the Savoy wasnt completely squeaky clean. It took us around 30 mins to get a simple iron and ironing board sent to the room. I know our butler wanted to do it but I expected the Savoy to be a little quicker. | Then at dinner my wife ordered prawns and to our surprise and horror the poop sack was still left in!! CHEF!!! | But, putting all this to one side our one night stay at the Savoy was a total experience and one in which we will never forget! | Oh! I almost forgot  breakfast! Nah! Im not going to tell you. You have to experience it yourself!",Telford,4/27/2012
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Absolutely Superb!,"We stayed at the Apex London Wall 30th Nov / 1st December as part of our wedding anniversary celebrations. We chose this hotel based on previous guests reviews on Tripadvisor. We spent the day shopping in the west end and we had booked a meal for the evening at a restaurant in Covent Garden. | On arrival at the Hotel, the reception staff were very welcoming and as we had advised them on booking that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, we were upgraded to a junior suite on the 2nd floor (for which we were very grateful). On entering the suite, it really did have a ""WOW"" factor, extremely well appointed, spotlessly clean and stylish, on the bed we had rose petals in the shape of a heart, (very romantic) some chocolates and an Anniversary card from reception staff, which we thought was a very nice personal touch. We were made to feel very special. | We had a large bathroom complete with our own rubber duck.The Shower was Amazing! | As the hotel is in the business district Saturday night / Sunday was very quiet no traffic noise whatsoever. | Breakfast on the Sunday morning I have to say has to be of the best breakfasts ever, it was all freshly cooked to order !! | Thank you to all the staff for making our anniversary weekend extra special at the Apex London Wall. Great Hotel, with very attentive staff. | We would certainly recommend and hopefully will return.",Hornchurch Essex,12/4/2013
The Dorchester,5,Myths & legends,"Welcome to Mayfair, Take a break to walk through the borough, in between Harrods and regent street (20 min), run around Hyde park in front of the hotel at 6 in the morning before opening your journey for the day. | A wide and spacious room, silent and comfortable! The old fashion British designed bathroom has an outdated charm, very well equipped, and full of nice products for men and women. | Room service 24/7 is ultimately efficient, and thank you for ironing my tuxedo's shirt. | Try the grill! Meat is fine, perfectly grilled, I recommend, the service team is extremely professional, also at the bar. | One tiny regret, no cigar lounge, but a taste of perfection.","Lausanne, Switzerland",2/3/2015
The Savoy,5,Perfect trip for a special occasion,"My boyfriend booked the Savoy as a surprise for my 30th birthday. We went mid week which I think added to the charm of the visit as it was quiet and you could comfortably explore the hotel. | Arrival at the Savoy is an absolute pleasure as the entrance is beautiful and the service is excellent. We were greeted immediately by a member of staff who assisted check in and arranged for our luggage to be taken to the room. Whilst they escorted us to our room they gave us some history and background to the hotel which was very interesting. | The room itself was very charming, stylish and comfortable. We went for cocktails in the American Bar - the menu is interesting, inventive and and should please many cocktail fans! | My boyfriend had kindly booked a massage at the spa - the facilities are lovely and I had a brilliant full body massage. | We went for dinner at Kaspers where we were able to order from a vegan a la carte menu - this pleased us a great deal! The food was delicious and service impeccable. Our glasses were at no point empty and we felt as though the staff were incredibly attentive, without making us feel awkward - they often appeared out of nowhere! | After dinner we went to the Beaufort Bar which is a gorgeous, decadent, black and gold room where you can drink from a delightful cocktail menu. | Breakfast the next day was excellent, and we were again catered for well as vegans. | The hotel is absolutely stunning and if you enjoy a place with history and great style I would definitely recommend it. The service was at all times excellent an I would certainly return. This hotel will always be special to us because during our visit we got engaged!","Nottingham, United Kingdom",1/20/2015
The Rembrandt,4,"Great location, big room","I stayed in an executive room and it was really very nice. The hallway to the room seemed a bit dated, and the lobby was not especially inviting (I also couldn't get the printer to work for airline checkin), but these were minor issues. I skipped the hotel breakfast which seemed a bit pricy and not necessary since there are so many options within a block's walk. The best thing about it is the location, if you're planning to visit the Victoria &amp; Albert or other museums in the area. Can't beat the proximity to the S. Kensington tube, either.",Connecticut,4/16/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Rumpus Room,"We held a drinks party for our clients, and the venue, service and view were spectacular!!! | A special mention for Bertram who looked after us and nothing was too much trouble. | We will be returning in the not too distant future I am sure!!","London, United Kingdom",12/18/2015
The Savoy,5,Amazing!,"Loved it! The hotel is a very high standard and the staff are excellent. My deluxe room was large and as I was on the 8th facing internally it was very quiet, as I had requested. The beds were comfortable and housekeeping did a great job, a couple of times per day. A very good location for exploring London on foot. This will be my go to hotel for London.","Vancouver, Canada",8/11/2018
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Luxury personified,"This is a beautiful hotel within easy walking distance of the National and British Museums and the Tate Modern as well as Piccadilly and many more sites. Although pricey, the suite was magnificent with a very large well appointed bedroom, walk-in closet and extremely spacious luxurious bathroom ( separate toilet, shower and enormous tub, double sinks with tons of counter space. The staff were extremely helpful and made our stay absolutely delightful.","Jerusalem, Israel",6/23/2016
The Savoy,4,Very welcoming,Great team at the Savoy made us feel very welcome. Good to see high standards of team work and ensuring that everything was at an excellent standard. The Doormen are excellent ambassadors of the Hotel.,Berkshire,10/13/2018
The Dorchester,5,I hope to come and for the fourth time,"Should not talk too much when it comes to this hotel. | Cleanliness is perfect, which is what attracted me to come for the third time. | Breakfast is very nice as service, of course. | Staff very professional and kind, also patient, witch is very important to me.","London, United Kingdom",4/18/2013

Ridgemount Hotel,4,Pleasantly surprised,"When planning my trip to London I was a little wary of the range of reviews the hotel had received, ranging from cesspit to best hotel ever! However given the price and location I thought it was worth risking for at least one night. We ended up staying almost a week! I won't claim it's the best hotel I've ever stayed at (not even in the top 5) but it is definitely the best value I've ever encountered. The staff were exceptionally helpful, the rooms were fine (after all, it's only somewhere to sleep) and the breakfast was nice (Trad. English). What sold it to me in the first place was the location, and I wasn't disappointed. Much of central London is within walking distance and you really feel you are in the heart and soul of the city. | If money is no object then I wouldn't stay here but, if like most of us, you are travelling on a budget then the Ridgemount is definitely a hotel I would recommend.",Montpon,1/31/2007
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",4,Small but perfectly formed,"As with many hotels located in major cities the rooms here are small. | I booked a twin which is larger than a standard double in floor space but even so things were tight with no room to lay even a small cabin bag. Ordinarily I would leave my bag in the wardrobe but this is not possible when the hangers are placed facing forward, The hotel are clearly aware of this as they tell you your empty luggage can be stored with the concierge. | Fortunately our room was located a couple of floors up on the side of the building although this meant we had no view it also meant we were sheltered from the road noise other reviewers refer to. | You don't come to London to spend time sitting in your hotel room so neither the size nor the lack of view worried us. | The hotel is located within a couple of minutes walk of the underground (Earls court one way Gloucester Road the other) and 10-15 minutes from the museums in Kensington. There are a few eateries located within walking distance if you don't want to head to other parts of the city, we didn't try these personally, there is also a Sainsbury's right next door. | Whilst this is by no means my favourite hotel in the city it's by far from the worst and i would book to stay here again given the reasonable pricing. | The staff were all incredibly friendly yet professional and are a credit to the hotel.","Aintree, United Kingdom",7/17/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Stylish spot by the river,"Just stopped there for a drink today but will defo return asap. | Stylish but relax and friendly, the whole staff made us feel welcome ( when all we wanted was a cup of tea ) . We got first class service from Monika . | Just illustrates how people make a place.. | Food looks delicious. Clean and comfy..All good.",NA,12/11/2016
Ridgemount Hotel,4,Great location and value for money near the centre of London,"We had a few nights staying at the Ridgemount at the end of August. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The included breakfast and table service was more than we expected. Around 15 minutes walk to Leicester Square. | We found that it was quicker when taking the tube from Heathrow, to change onto the northern line and then walk the short distance from Goodge Street station. Russell Square station was quite a bit further away.",Auckland,9/20/2016
The Dorchester,5,"Luxurious hotel, a real treat.","A wonderful hotel, staff very polite, professional, and not snobbish like some staff in hotels we have stayed at, they couldn't do enough for u? Our room was spotless, and quiet. Champaign, cake and chocolates complimentary in our room. Bed and pillows very comfortable. We had cocktails in the bar which were lovely, and breakfast was great.",NA,4/2/2012
The Dorchester,4,Lovely hotel but not the best London has to offer,"Stayed here during the Christmas period with my husband. The Dorchester is a lovely 'grande dame' of a hotel, but I honestly don't think it's worth the price tag. Although opulent it's no where near as gorgeous as Claridges, nor as chic. That said, the service was good, our room was very nice and our children loved their sweets from the festive sweet shop. Special mention to the shop assistant who was lovely.","Nottingham, United Kingdom",3/12/2018
The Savoy,5,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed at The Savoy for 2 nights to celebrate a significant birthday. From the moment we arrived from the moment we left we were made to feel really special. The lady who checked us in was lovely and although the room wasn't quite ready they took our luggage and said they would ring us when the room was ready which they did. The room was fantastic, very clean and had everything you required and our cases were already in the room waiting for us. The hotel was spotless and whenever you passed a member of staff was always acknowledged. We went to both of the bars on both of the nights. The cocktails were expensive as you can imagine but when you take into consideration the quality of the cocktails, the service and the surroundings it is well worth it. When we retired for the evening the bed had been turned down, there was a bottle of water on each of the bedside cabinets and a pair of slippers were at the side of the bed ready to step into. We had an amazing experience and are planning our next visit already.","North Yorkshire, United Kingdom",3/5/2017
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Uno dei migliori,"Uno dei migliori hotel provati, elegante, classico, posizione centrale, servizio perfetto e qualità del sonno ottima. | Si trova vicino ai grandi magazzini harrods, ristorante solo in giacca( non provato) | Completo di tutti i servizi possibili ad un prezzo alto ma ne vale la pena.","Milan, Italy",12/14/2016
The Savoy,5,London at its Best,"Loved everything about the Savoy Hotel, from location to the exceptional service from all staff. Epitomizes elegance. Enjoy the vibrant atmosphere at this location.

I will go back to London and stay at the Savoy.","Fort Lauderdale, Florida",11/9/2016

Las Jr. Suites tienen increíble vista a Knightsbridge y con un poco más de dinero puedes tener vista al Parque. | Desayuno delicioso con vista a la guardia Montada a las 10:30 am e increíble servicio de Concierge, SPA y Front Desk. | Tanto de negocios como de placer, altamente recomendable.","Mexico City, Mexico",10/20/2014
Rhodes Hotel,4,"Excellent location, reasonable value","The hotel has been recently furnished in a faux grecian/cretan decor reflecting the Rhodes name. The owners have gone to quite a bit of trouble with the decor, even the carpets in the hallways are high quality. Our room (standard double) was clean and well furnished. Like a lot of London hotels the room size was never big and fitting the modern en-suite was always going to be a squeeze. The owners got around the problem of finding a wall of sufficient size to fit the double bed with the novel solution of narrowing the doorway! The dining room is in the basement and is therefore a little claustrophobic and not big enough to sit all the guests at one time hence breakfast is when you can get in between 7.30am and 10.00am. The breakfast itself was perfectly adequate and the service prompt. Overall we found the hotel more than satisfactory and would happily stay again.","Melbourne, Australia",5/25/2011
The Savoy,2,A lot of money for the suite but the stay was not perfect,"We were 40 mins late checking in I had given myself an hour to propose to my fiancee and then had an appointment with a jeweller, this appointment got halved due to the delay. This might not seen much but if you pay these kind of prices you don't expect any hassel. | Also the butler said my clothes would be pressed within 15-20mins and it took twice as long, which made me rush to get ready to go out. The room and hotel was beautiful, but my expectations of them were higher.",cobham,3/14/2015

The Savoy,5,A memorable night,"We recently had a night at The Savoy on a holiday to England. We had adjoining rooms for the children and were extremely comfortable. The rooms were a very generous size, the bathrooms were lovely (with speakers to listen to music) and the beds were extremely comfortable. I would have to say the pillows were the most amazing pillows I've ever slept on. Where can I buy those? | Dinner at Kaspar's was stunning and delicious and the breakfast was beautiful. | Overall, a very highly recommended hotel for that very special night!",NA,1/21/2014
The Savoy,5,"Great location, great service, great renovations",We had heard the Savoy had done a significant upgrade in prior to the 2012 Olympics. It showed. The rooms were traditional but very nicely redone. The staff was always helpful and professional. They even provided some Savoy toy cats for my girls and candy which helped with the jet lag. As a family we were trying to get to a number of museums which made the Savoy's location extremely convenient.,NA,8/17/2016

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful service","We stayed just the one night in a riverbank room on one of their special rates that included dinner. First off, let's just say that this is not a cheap hotel - we are after all talking about London, and about a prime riverfront location close to the City. However, for a special occasion it is worth saving up for it, especially if you are not quite able to afford the super crazy prices of the top tier hotels but still want to stay somewhere that is stylish, modern and with good service and fine food. | Having seen the web page of the hotel, my preconception was that this might be the type of place with snooty ""arty"" guests and hotel staff that are above themselves (having seen this before in other design hotels). Believe me, nothing could be further than the truth, at least as far as staff are concerned. The staff in this hotel are a credit to it - it is clear that human resources did very well in recruitment. Maybe they are a little too enthusiastic, but I might also be if I worked in such a stunning hotel! | The location is prime for both tourist and business travellers. The former will find themselves on the South Bank, which is one of the more visitor-friendly parts of town, while the latter find themselves on the doorstep of the City, with Blackfriars Station just steps away. The riverside setting is stunning, especially at night and the river view rooms are worth the extra money. | The rooms themselves are extremely comfortable, tastefully decorated and a very generous size for London. Unlike other designer hotels, functionality has not been sacrificed on the altar of trendiness. The only minor point I would have is that wardrobe space might be limited for those that are staying more than a few days - but not a big issue in my opinion as the rooms are large enough. | The food is excellent. The menu is not too large, and at first glance does not appear to be anything special. But these guys know how to turn a humble vegetable like a potato or sprout into something that tastes like a delicacy. Full marks there. | Are there ""better"" hotels in London? It obviously depends what you are looking for, but if you want to stay somewhere well-located with stunning river views, with well-proportioned rooms and excellent food and service standards, and with a relaxed atmosphere, then save up your money because this hotel is special. I will definitely come back.",Cyprus,2/9/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,A change,"Being a regular visitor to London I normally stay at my club but this trip decided on a change.we were attending an event at the barbican so looked for somewhere closer. Apex hotels in scotland are great and so decided to try their ventures in 'the smoke'. First impressions, a hotel designed as I like it. Small reception, no grand atrium, money spent on the rooms and bathrooms. Visit was at the weekend so forget anything local being open, no problem if you are aware before. Had to eat at the hotel on sat night. Service was good. Food very average at best, but understandable due to its 'closing down' at the weekend. Would I stay again? Maybe not, only because of location. Would I stay at an apex in the west? Yes please! Let's go for it chaps, you are great north of the border, keep up the good work. M",yorkshire,1/15/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Weekend in London,"Fabulous Hotel, close to everything. Great design. A bit pricey though, but well worth it.

The Savoy,5,Absolutely amazing,"It would be fantastic if everybody could experience this hotel in their lifetime. | It has an amazing reputation and lived up to all its expectations. The thing that strikes you more than anything is the staff, they seem to love their job , they want to help you and they are all turned out absolutely perfectly. | The hotel itself was quite stunning, it was so regal, classy every room was just stunning. | I honestly feel this has been the best hotel I've ever stayed in and I have stayed in some fantastic places around the world but I am going to struggle to beat this. | If I had one criticism it would be there are no free nibbles in the room, so where as with most five-star hotels you expect to get oat biscuits or ginger biscuits with a cup of tea , at the Savoy you have to pay very inflated prices for something to take away the hunger pains if you're in between meals. | However that is a very small negative, the experience I've had over the last two days has been quite fantastic.",High peak,1/28/2017
The Lanesborough,5,Afternoon tea with mother,Wonderful. Far better than The Ritz (slow and stiff) and Harvey Nichols (noisy and showy). | The service is unsurpassable. Extensive range of teas.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,A Last Minute Decision,"This is a great New LONDON Hotel and has a Very Vibrant Outlook. We booked at the last minute on Open Table, sometimes Good and Sometimes Bad. | Regrettably for us this was a bad decision. | We booked for 10:30pm and arrived at 10:00pm. We said we were early and We were asked for our Name. Name given and our booking reference I felt maybe we had done the wrong thing-arriving early or using a booking company. | I don't know Booking Companies Policy with Hotels or Restaurants, there is obviously more to it than meets Our Eyes. | We ate our meal-Which is Always First Class-Breakfast-Brunch/Lunch or a late Dinner, so I was surprised. | We didn't use The Outside Bar at the Top this time after Dinner. It's a Brilliant place to finish the night or even just go up for a Drink. | All this aside It's still One of My Favourite LONDON Destinations. Even got a Brilliantly Served and Tasty Burger on the Hoof. | It's All Down To The Staff. They Are Good.","London, United Kingdom",7/19/2017

Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Zakenhotel met een romantische uitstraling,"We waren een weekendje in London om onze zoon te bezoeken en gingen de laatse nacht in het Apex London Wall Hotel. Ideale ligging, op loopafstand van Liverpool Street Station. Daar we ook al in een Apex hotel in Edinburgh waren, hadden we ons al wel een beetje op luxe voorbereid. maar dit trof alle verwachtingen. We hadden de junior suite. Super mooi en tot in de details perfekt. Een geweldige badkamer, bad en douche gescheiden. Het enorme kingsize bed was met rozeblaadjes bezaaid. erg romantisch. 2TV's waren misschien een beetje overdreven. Minibar goed gevuld. Het balkon konden we helaas niet gebruiken vanwege de regen. 's Avonds met de kinderen in het restaurant gegeten, waar een hele warme sfeer hing. Het diner was ook overheerlijk. Een mooie kaart met passende wijnen. De bediening was erg aangenaam, vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Al met al een super afsluiting van een heerlijk weekendje London.","Lingen, Germany",11/11/2015

Corinthia Hotel London,5,Excelent,"I had the pleasure of stay at The Corinthia few weeks ago. The hotel is brand new and trully luxury but still cosy and welcoming. I stayed in one of the superior rooms and it was absolutely stunning; spacious, sparkling clean and had all the little details that you could expect from a top luxury 5 stars property (charging almost £500.00 per room per night) I loved the floating remote controler for the TV on the bathroom! I decided to spend the whole day at the hotel (believe me; once you get in the hotel you don't want to go out!), had a georgeous english breakfast on bed and after I went to the SPA...The SPA is simply amazing, the best in town no doubt!I also had the chance to experience both Massimo and The Northall (restaurants) I loved Massimo, great seafood (amazing oysters selection) and reasonable value but I found The Northall quite standard and a bit over priced for what it is although it's cheaper than Massimo I would recomend to try this one. The Corinthia is a luxury property but still cosy and home feeling. The rates are high (very high) but the hotel is lovely and the service amazing.","London, United Kingdom",1/10/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,A wonderful treat,"We were discussing where to go for the May Day bank holiday weekend when I saw an offer for this hotel. As it was our wedding anniversary AND the hotel was once the office my now husband I met in, I booked a night for a treat - we never stay in London hotels as we only live 15 miles away. | I emailed the hotel to check re room types and views (ideally I wanted close to where our old office had been!), and was promptly offered free cocktails. We arrived to check in and told Isabel our story - she promptly upgraded us to a balcony suite - wow! The room was stylish, but comfortable. It was shame it was too cold to sit out on the balcony, the evening service included lighting lantern candles outside. | We used the vouchers to go to Rumpus Room and had a great cocktail/ mocktail each. The inclusive breakfast was OK, just not a great fan of buffets, but plenty of choice. | When we checked out we again told the story of our meeting, and were advised to go to the spa to see part of the old reception desk. We did and were promptly given a tour by the spa manager, explaining how the spa had been created from the storage rooms in the basement. You'd never have guessed as it was a very light airy space. | The hotel is made by the quality of its staff, they are a credit to the business. It sounds like all have been there since the hotel was opened, some were even involved in the planning. | Whilst it is trendy, its not to the detriment of comfort; I could quite happily have spent several days there. It was shame it was only one night and we'd already got dinner reservations. | Next time we go we'll use the gym and spa and just hope we can enjoy it as much without the suite!!","Reigate, United Kingdom",5/2/2016
The Savoy,5,Night at the Savoy Hotel.,"A wonderful stay. We were thoroughly spoilt. This was a memorable stay. We were given this stay at the Savoy Hotel as a thank you present. Every area was superb from the reception through to The American Bar, Kaspers and our room was also excellent. It was also my birthday and I was very well looked after! Thank you for everything. |","Bristol, United Kingdom",5/25/2014
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",3,"This hotel bills itself as five stars, but...","I gave this hotel three stars based on price charged versus value received. The price charged for rooms is very high, but there are some problems that could be easily addressed. One is that they charge for WiFi - really? You get free WiFi at a Hampton Inn, for heaven's sake. I really felt ""nickled and dimed"" by this. Also, they very nicely give you your choice of newspaper hanging on your door in the morning, which is a nice perk, but somewhat expected at this level. The problem is that there wasn't one on the morning we left. If you're traveling, you would actually have time to read a newspaper, and you did actually pay for the room the night before. Also, I asked for a top sheet on my bed twice on two separate days from two separate maids and never got one. | On the plus side, the two restaurants in the hotel are some of the best in London, the location is terrific - especially the Hyde Park side of the hotel, and generally the service was good - but I'm still having trouble getting over the WiFi thing (apparently a corporate decision), and it has put me off the whole Mandarin Oriental chain.","denver, co",6/7/2012
Rhodes Hotel,4,Nice hotel with friendly staff,"In the room we had everything we needed and the Wi-Fi was functioning well. The room was kept very clean. The bathroom was small, but very well functioning with shower cabin and good ventilation. The breakfast was excellent with fresh fruits, yoghurt, cheese etc.. The staff in the breakfast room was extremely helpful and attentive - it felt like they could read your mind :)","Helsinki, Finland",4/13/2016
The Rembrandt,4,Londra old style,"A pochi metri di distanza dal museo di storia naturale di londra esiste un pezzo di vecchia inghilterra..il Rembrandt...sale e reception poco illuminate,un pò datate, ma molto british.. | E' ideale per chi come me piace lo stile britannico, con il ricco buffet all'inglese del breakfast | piuttosto che il meno raccomandabile dinner serale. | La posizione è invidiabile, a 500 metri da Harrods e dal più bel parco di Londra !! | Nello stesso stabile si può trovare una SPA convenzionata per i clienti dell'Hotel ...piscina,sauna e palestra..very good .. | è sicuramente da provare !!","Tuscany, Italy",11/21/2013
Rhodes Hotel,4,Agradable experiencia,"Buena situación, cerca de Paddington y Lancaster, desde donde moverte fácilmente. Te dejan guardar las maletas en la recepción tanto si llegas antes de la hora de entrada como al irte si tu avión sale tarde. Trato exquisito en la recepción y en el desayuno (bastante completo), muy atentos, muy familiar, como si estuvieras en casa. Es cierto que la sala del desayuno es pequeña, pero acogedora. Limpieza perfecta, con cambio de toallas a diario y de sábanas cada dos días. Por poner una pega...al no tener ascensor como te toque en el último piso...al finalizar el día cuesta llegar a la habitación, aunque también es cierto que las maletas te las suben a la entrada. Señal wifi correcta. A tener en cuenta que lo que yo buscaba, buen precio, comodidad, limpieza, accesibilidad a metro. No es lujoso ni tiene vistas impresionantes, pero.. ¿volvería?. Sin duda. Calidad-precio garantizado.",NA,10/5/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,An amazing hotel,Everything I expected and more. Very clean room. Spacious with a balcony. With easy access to transport links and very central. Friendly receptionist. Will definitely use the hotel again if I happen to need it. Highly recommended.,"London, United Kingdom",7/26/2018
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Stylish and great location,"We spent one night there. Great location to sight-seeing. Restaurant served lovely food, interesting and creative plates of food. The cocktail bar at the top was the best, amazing view. Booking advisable to get a seat but well worth it! Nice shower room too. Will be back one day.","Upton upon Severn, United Kingdom",2/20/2017
Ridgemount Hotel,4,Great location for visiting London,"I recently stayed at the Ridgemount Hotel for nine nights during July 2013. I'd previously stayed at the Arran House Hotel in 2007, so knew the area well and was keen to stay in Gower Street again. The Ridgemount was recommended by my Travel Agent who'd stayed there herself. I stayed in Room 16 on the ground floor - a single room with ensuite, and also very small, but it had everything you needed. Unfortunately London was entering a heat wave at this time, so I was more concerned about security, being on the ground floor, and needing to leave windows open. The owners were quite willing to move me, but I would have had to wait a couple of days as the hotel was full, and the new room would have been right at the top. After a night in the ""broom cupboard"" I decided it was fine, and chose small room and NO STAIRS, over having to struggle up several flights of stairs to the top floor! | The room and hotel were spotlessly clean, rooms fully cleaned every day, my ensuite was a reasonable size, and further inspection on the first day revealed a hair-dryer, as I'd taken a punt on leaving mine at home, AND not one but TWO fans, the larger one of which gave out quite a ferocious breeze - handy in the heat wave as you can imagine. My room looked out onto the garden area at the back, so no traffic noise. One window had bars on it, so could stay open at night, but I left both open without any problems. The only downside of dwelling in the garden broom-cupboard, was that one morning, a couple of young ladies were smoking in the garden, and one of them actually peered through my window as I was getting ready for the day's sightseeing. After telling them ""to get lost because it wasn't the zoo (though in rather more impolite terms), they were never seen again!! | Overall I had a great stay, and felt thoroughly at home - the owners Mr and Mrs Rees, and their son Aled were wonderful, and it was like staying in a family home. Breakfasts were quite filling, and the staff very friendly with prompt, efficient service. I never had to wait for anything, although the fact that my room was right next to the stairs down to the breakfast room, meant I got there fairly early each day. Mr Rees is a never-ending fount of knowledge about public transport and sight-seeing, and even though I am quite familiar with London, he could always give me some tips on shorter routes that I hadn't thought about, especially the ""quick way"" to King's Cross station on my last morning. Most invaluable when lugging one's port for blocks! | The hotel also has free WIFI, two guest computers in the lounge, drink machines, and the staff will wash and dry your laundry for 5 pounds - I did this twice, and it was wonderful. Location in Gower Street is brilliant - walking distance to Goodge Street Tube station, and others, also not far from Euston St, King's Cross Stations and the Eurostar. You can walk into the West End, buses run along Gower Street and the nearby Tottenham Court Road all day and night, stacks of pubs, restaurants etc., nearby in Tottenham Court Road and surrounds. | Apart from the heat, it was a great stay, and I'd definitely recommend the Ridgemount Hotel for travellers looking for an economic, friendly, and spotlessly clean central place to stay in London. I will be back, but definitely in much colder weather!!","Rockhampton, Australia",8/16/2013
Newham Hotel,1,Nightmares,"The other reviews do not exaggerate. When I got there a man was arguing loudly with the man in the lobby. He was trying to leave before his reservation ended, and get some of his money back. I should have taken this as a cue to leave. The location is lousy, my room had a stench that was a mixture of bugs and smoke (even though it was a non-smoking room). The communal shower's drain was clogged so, despite only a trickle of water making its way out of the shower head, I was in standing water within a minute. It was easily the worst hotel in which I have stayed.","Indianapolis, Indiana",7/15/2012
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Mysigt hotell med kanonbra läge,"Mysigt hotell, rent och fräscht, trevlig personal som gärna delar med sig av tips och idéer om hur du ska uppleva London.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Great afternoon tea,Booked as a present the Wild tea £55.. Brilliant cocktails served between each course of the tea. All very freshly prepared. A bit mean on the savoury items but lots of pastries. All served on Portmerion china. Friendly staff with funky music in the background. Great views of the Thames. A very trendy hotel with a young vibe.,"London, United Kingdom",4/27/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Incredible experience,"My husband and I recently stayed a night in a corner suite for our anniversary. The staff made the effort for our stay to be extra special. The room was absolutely fabulous - stunningly decorated, spacious and had everything we needed. I also had an incredible 80 min massage at Aqua Spa which I highly recommend. The staff at the spa were friendly and attentive and my masseuse was excellent. I can't wait to come back and stay and enjoy the facilities. Thank you!","London, United Kingdom",10/23/2017
Rhodes Hotel,5,Perfect place for your London stay,"The Rhodes Hotel is a cozy, well-located gem in London. Near Paddington station and a couple of metro stations, you can get anywhere from there easily. The rooms are small, but more than adequate, with nice modern bathrooms and comfortable beds. And you simply cannot beat the staff! Very friendly and helpful, making you feel right at home. I can't recommend Rhodes Hotel enough and going forward will stay there every time I visit London.","Santa Rosa, California",12/17/2013
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Small sized hotel offers great experience.,"I was under the impression the hotel was larger than it actually is. That was a bit troubling to me at first, but very quickly I realized its relatively small size is in fact one its many charms. The reception concierges were very kind, friendly and informative. Regretfully, I can't remember their names, except for Lukasz, in part because, by coincidence, I got most of the assistance from him. Most importantly, however, Lukasz gave me all sorts of tips and advice that made my first visit to London an absolute success. In fact, he responded several of my inquiries by email even before I made my reservations. Everyone there was pleasant. I was looking forward to their splendid breakfast because of the people working in the restaurant. Again, I wish I could remember their names, especially the enthusiastic and friendly Argentinian manager (was it Marcela?). As for the room, it's relatively big, comfortable, stylish and quiet. The bathroom is also nice; yet the bathtub nozzle is strangely and obtrusively located on the side. Everything else was great, though. Got complimentary Pringles, jelly beans, Wi-Fi and, yes, a small rubber ducky (rubber duck forums over the net seem to take this quite seriously). At any rate, I had a great stay. And, given the fact that London can be very expensive, my room (with breakfast included) was reasonably priced.","San Juan, Puerto Rico",11/24/2013
Corinthia Hotel London,5,One of the best service,We are still at Corinthia. My husband is on work trip and we decided to stay at the same hotel for few personal days first. The staff was very courteous and gave us a nice upgrade (thanks Jean Louis) since we would be here for 10 days... I have a two year old and hotel staff went above and beyond to store his food and heated his meals (thanks Rui Costa). The hotel is very clean. I am one of those who can see dirt behind frames and this hotel hasn't disappointed me yet. The cups/glass were a bit dusty but nothing major. The rain shower is amazing and the various lighting modes are smart. The light fixtures are placed in a subtle way in the bathroom that it is bright but not in your face lighting. Movement sensor on walkin closet is my favorite . Need to get one of those for my own closet. Very convenient. | The location is very convenient. It is on a nice quiet street and not far from the crowded tourist places. Would definitely come back to stay.,"Bayonne, New Jersey",11/26/2011
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,"Great Stay, fab room","The Mondrian did not dissapoint. I have been to the one here in Miami and it is always good. The Mondrian at sea containers was no exception. Great location by the river Thames and close to many restaurants, shops, London Eye, Borough Market... | We arrived early in the morning and our room was not ready yet, but they did offer their spa facilities for us to shower and change if desired. We went for a walk and explore and within a couple hours the hotel called us that our room was ready. | The room itself was very large, the king size bed was a selling point for us since it is so hard to find a true king size in Europe. Most beds are two twins jined together andd that is very uncomfortable. The bed was large and super comfortable. We had a studio room with a very large bathroom, luxurious all around, marble floor and counter tops and molton Brown products and toiletries. | The tub was great even though i am not a tub person, i prefer showers. The shower was separate room from the toilet room, nice touch. | Shower was a nice rain shower. | room had a desk and plenty of closet space.The hotel even provided us with a cell phone to use for local calls, internet, etc... | We ate at the Sea Containers restaurant a couple of times and the food was very good. We did find the service lacking a bit at the restaurant though... | The service at the hotel was very good. Special mentioned to Amy who knew we were celebrating our anniversary and sent us a certificate for free drinks at the Rooftop bar, which by the way, was beautiful, with great views but packed! | Everything was very clean and the hotel smells so nice, but that is typical of all Mondrian hotels. | Overall it was a great experience at this hotel.","Miami, Florida",8/16/2016
The Rembrandt,3,Expensive hotel and small room,Stayed 2 nights in business. Well located near tube and city center. Good full english breakfast. Too expensive for the small room I got. Be aware of the maid that knocks on the door very early even at check out day,"Portimao, Portugal",11/9/2011
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Exceptional staff,"I booked 2 rooms for 3 nights, both rooms were very comfortable, well equipped and spotlessly clean. I loved all the little extras including the high end toiletries, slippers, huge bath towels and my teenager especially enjoyed the daily replenished jelly beans and hot chocolate. The best part of our stay and the reason I would return was the staff. Every staff member from housekeeper to wait staff was friendly, courteous and willing to go out of their way to be helpful. The hotel is the heart of the City/Financial district, so busy mid-week and quiet on the weekend.","Seattle, Washington",2/16/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Exceptional Staff,"We stayed here on the 6th May 2016 for my partners Birthday. We arrived at the hotel around 11 o clock and although it was too early to get our room we thought we would leave our bags at the lobby and do a spot of shopping. There were 2 members off staff on the front desk, a young woman and a tall gentleman (I'm short) who I think may have been called Lukas but I forgot to check the name badge. Both members off staff were very friendly and welcoming. Lukas (I hope that's his name and if not then it is for this review) checked us in so we wouldn't have to do it later on and took our bags for us. We then headed off into London. | We used the Moorgate Tube Station which is a short 3-5 min walk from the hotel which for us was brilliant as some hotels we have previously stopped in are a long way from the Tube. It was nice to stay somewhere that was so easy to travel from. | We returned to the hotel around 3 and were greeted once again by Lukas and his female colleague. We were given our key to the room and then a welcoming glass of Prosecco (a million times better than a cookie). | The room was amazing. We had a deluxe King with a balcony upgrade. The bathroom was huge with a spacious shower, big sink and the biggest free standing bath I have ever seen. There was a Nespresso machine with various pods, jelly beans, Pringles and biscuits all complimentary. The room had a sofa at the end of the bed so you could sit and watch tv and the coffee table had a selection of magazines on. The balcony was huge and it was a really nice day but unfortunately their were workmen doing something to the roof of the building opposite and so didn't really use it. There was a note on the dressing table that the building was being renovated and so there would be some work being carried out between certain times. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a log which is unusual for me. We didn't try the restaurant as we had already booked a table at San Carlo Cichetti's in Covent Garden and we overslept so just grabbed a costa for breakfast. | On checkout we were dealt with once again by Lukas and the same female colleague (don't you let your staff go home?) they were very friendly and helpful yet again. The level of service we received was exceptional, I despise bad service and have high expectations but the staff we encountered at Apex London Wall Hotel blew me away. I have always been impressed with the staff and service provided at Apex hotels ( we have previously stayed at Apex Temple Court, Apex City of Edinburgh, Apex Grassmarket and Waterloo Place) and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend any of them. Many thanks to all of the staff for making our stay so enjoyable.",NA,5/17/2016
The Lanesborough,5,"Iconic, Incredible, Inimitable","We may have been the first guests at The Lanesborough after an extensive renovation, having just stayed at Fregate Island. I was so impressed with the Oetker Collection that I started a TripAdvisor account to describe this venerable hotel. Like many of the Lanesboroughs future guests, weve stayed/have upcoming trips at the finest hotels/resorts in the world (Aman, Four Seasons, COMO, etc). | Although we arrived while still the ""soft opening,"" when things aren't fully up and running, we found this to be a place with a soul and character that can't quite be described, and no doubt it comes from the GM whos been here since the beginning when this was once a Rosewood. You are treated as a family member, friend and a VIP. The heart of the hotel beats whenever you enter: genuine smiles and a sense of awesomeness. The doormen, concierge and car service are just amazingly friendly and fun. | I could go on and on, but let me just provide one vignette. The head concierge, Simon Thomas, is the one person in the city who can get you any seat anywhere. He was able to secure us a reservation on Friday night at the Chef's Table at Dinner by Heston during Wimbledon, which is no doubt the most difficult table to get in all Europe. Can the Four Seasons do that? Highly doubtful. And we are just regular guests, not the billionaire or celebrity or royalty that often frequent the halls. | Everything is taken care of so that you can just enjoy life. A vintage Rolls, no problem. Babysitting, of course. An amazingly memorable birthday, done. Lunch with the queen, perhaps. | Absolutely perfect and absolutely the place well return to often. I remember watching The Grand Budapest Hotel and dreamt of such a place. Here it is, with charming Gustave front and center. Just go. Everything is beyond perfect, from the fixtures to the Eggs Benedict.",NA,7/10/2015
The Savoy,5,Wonderful afternoon tea experience!,"I could not disagree more with the two most recent reviews of afternoon tea at the Savoy. I went on 17th August with two friends, we found the whole experience absolutely wonderful. The welcome and the service was absolutely fantastic. Our waiter explained thoroughly what we could expect and spent some time discussing our choice of tea with us. A second plate of sandwiches was brought before we had even finished the first, and we were offered a second helping of scones. We declined this (knowing that there were cakes &amp; pastries to come!) but more cream and preserves were brought immediately we requested them. As it turned out, we just did not have enough room to finish all the courses and were given the remaining cakes to take away in a lovely black box. | One of my friends was celebrating her 60th birthday, and the other is on a gluten-free diet, and every member of staff who attended to us in the Thames Foyer was aware of this. A little cake was brought out for the birthday girl, to the piano accompaniment of Happy Birthday, My gluten-free friend was delighted to find such an array of tasty treats available for her. | We travelled from Manchester and back in a day for the Savoy experience and it was well worth it!",Manchester,8/22/2013

Corinthia Hotel London,5,Fabulous venue,Having been to most major hotels in London I must admit that I had never heard of the Corinthia and had to get in a cab to attend a conference. Since I have been a member of the Liberal Club I was surprised I didn't spot the hotel as it's across the road.

"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",5,Girls' weekend city break,"Okay, I adore this hotel. My friend and I stayed at their suite over a weekend. We had a lovely time, it was just perfect for our lil girly time of shopping and some night life. Knightsbridge retail hubs and the West End were each within a stone's throw away. The tube station (Piccadilly line - straight to Heathrow) was also just next to the hotel. But if we wanted to avoid walking or public transport in our little numbers and heels, the helpful concierge took care of us with their Rolls Royce service, which is free within 1.5km radius. | The hotel itself is totally elegant and chic. Love the art deco interiors. Our suite is beautiful and has everything we needed: comfy beds for two, spacious bathroom with proper lighting suitable for putting on your make-up (which a lot of other hotels get wrong!!), and can I just say, they have the best slippers I've tried on! Plus we had a lovely butler who made sure we were taken cared of, she even provided us with extra shampoo and conditioners for our long hair and made sure we received a good turn down service. | At first I was slightly disappointed that our room was not facing the park, but when I peeped out the window, it was actually a lovely cityscape of London. | All throughout our stay, we felt like VIPs, thanks to the staff and excellent accommodation.

The Savoy,2,Shame on the Savoy!,"A first class hotel is first class all the way, in every aspect, anticipating the guest needs before they arrive and doing their homework on their guest. The Savoy London failed in this area. No recognition for being an AMX Centurion member. No acknowledgement for being loyal Fairmont President club members. The first room given was so small I could not open my luggages, truly no joking. The room had shutters for the bathroom door. One half window that looked into the saddest view that I have ever seen with fake flowers in some pot looking at you. Disgusting! I felt like I was sleeping in a box. I felt claustrophobic. I changed rooms the second day to a better room that at least I could open my luggages. What pissed me off was the fact the front desk agent had rooms to upgrade me to however their supervisor did not approve the upgrade as they wanted to upsell the rate. Already paying 800$ US a night you would think you would get a room that at least. You could open. Your luggages in and have a bathroom where the door was a real door not a pair of wooden shutters! When I think of my experience at the famous Savoy Hotel I laugh because it was so bad and was far from the first class experience that I was anticipating. Two weeks before staying here I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental London Hyde Park and that hotel has it right, knowing how to treat their customers, first class all the way!!! Time for the Savoy to take lessons from other hotels in their category of business or step away from this competitive market. If in London again I would not choose this hotel again as there are other first class hotels that have better prices and better services than this one. I have to admit, commend and recognize the stellar bellman that looked after our bags and the stellar concierge that booked our car service back to LHR. Both were outstanding and deserve merit ay from this poor review of the general hotel. One more thing that I have to mention which bothered me was the plastic curtain rods in the room to mp e th curtains. Have you heard of automated curtains or at least rods that will actually pull the curtain rather than doing nothing and risking breaking in your hand. The towel warming rods were always on which was a huge safety hazard if traveling with children. The last hotel we stayed at you could turn on and off the hot towel rods. No never again. Shame on the Savoy for claiming to be a first class hotel.","Toronto, Canada",8/2/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Perfect for the best Thames View in London,"Booked the suite as a spur of the moment as we wanted to view the Fire of London wood sculpture in the middle of the Thames. The view was perfect, but we were most surprised at how spacious and well designed the room was. | My wife and I have spent the last two weeks staying at various hotels on a trip through Europe and this was the best so far, We both had a great nights sleep it was not noisy even with the windows open. | The bathroom was spacious and well appointed and the living space was excellent with dining table, living area and work station, little touches like the tome's on London were excellent. | The balcony was full size the length of the room and had its own eating and sitting space perfect for river watching. | We ordered a couple of steaks through room service as the restaurant was a bit noisy for a romantic evening and they were still medium rare and warm! | Breakfast was also delicious and it was a shame that we both had to get to work early as the spa looked really enticing. | The only downside was that the rooftop bar was closed on Sunday nights as I had heard some amazing things about the drinks. | All the staff we encountered were courteous, great experience and even though we live in the West End would pick this spot again for a romantic night away!","London, United Kingdom",9/5/2016

The hotel is absolutely beautiful but our check was not good at all as we were asked to wait whilst our rooms were been prepared and this was after contacting the hotel and informing them that we would be arriving at 14:00pm and becos be we're travellimg with children would like the rooms interconnected. We were only taken to our rooms an 1h30 min later and the rooms separated and far apart . After some enquirers with the duty manger we then had to downgrade our rooms from executive to delux to have the rooms together . The stay after that was excellent. But checkout was a problem again . If the check in and out was better I would have given the Corinthia a big 5 stars , but there is room for improvements.","Durban, South Africa",8/19/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Weekends just don't get any better!,"This was just a quick pop up to London for some shopping and was the first time at the Corinthia. What a great hotel, staff were so good, professional and welcoming. We had to change the pillows owing to being allergic to feathers (probably should have informed them in advance and this was our error), but the staff just couldn't help us enough. The room was spacious, clean and the shower had a rain head which provided an absolute deluge! This is probably the best hotel shower we have ever had! | Certainly worth staying at this hotel, the standard is much higher then other 5 star hotels and having stayed at other top famous London hotels, we will certainly be returning to the Corinthia and it will be our first port of call.","Plymouth, United Kingdom",7/28/2013
The Lanesborough,1,Afternoon tea,"We booked a dairy free afternoon tea in this hotel, following the amazing reviews on the topic on both Time Out and the website of the hotel - to say we were disappointed with the offer, it's an understatement! We booked with more than two weeks in advance, and made it clear our dietary requirements. When we got there, a very polite waiter advised us he would check with the chef what the option were for the day - he never came back and after 10min a different waiter came to advise that we could only have the sandwiches and a fruit salad. Clearly nothing was prepared in advance for our visit and we had to seat there watching others having this amazing choice of sweets while we ate what every lower than average restaurant offers for people with this type of allergy. The cherry on top of the cake was that we were charged exactly the same as the normal menu when we couldn't even eat it! This misleading advertisement shouldn't be allowed for such a glamorous hotel.","London, United Kingdom",8/9/2015

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Loved it!,"If you're looking for a hotel with a difference, in a great location on Southbank. This is the one. | Amazing entrance, beautifully spacious room with am amazing view of The Thames, attentive staff and a rooftop cocktail terrace. Will sure be back :-)","Leicester, United Kingdom",6/17/2015
The Savoy,5,Afternoon Tea,"The Savoy Afternoon Tea is by far the best I have ever experienced. I have had afternoon tea at several top London Hotels. None is as good as this one.The recently refurbished Savoy has the most sumptuously elegant and beautiful halls and salons, and the flower displays are breathtaking.The staff are all highly professional yet warm and friendly . The pride they take in their job is palpable. Without being patronising or obsequious they create an atmosphere of welcome and a genuine interest in the customer. The tea was excellent. Firstly, the tea was hot. It was a bright and refreshing blend. The sandwiches were perfectly fresh and we were offered more. The scones were moist and soft and did not taste of bicarbonate. The pastries were heavenly. I would not go any else for afternoon tea.",London,8/24/2016
The Rembrandt,5,Amazing place for staying in London,"We stayed 4 nights in this hotel. There are many things why you have to choose the hotel. | First is the location, very close to the tube station and to the interesting museum. | Second is - friendly and nice staff | Third - clean rooms, good conception for the hotel, room with the amazing bathroom with super bathtub, good breakfast. | Points for improvement: Once the breakfast start is not acceptable the staff to talk to each other/gossiping for the costumer. Was unbelievable when two of the girls were going nothing but gossiping during the breakfast. Everyone van heard them, is not professional at all! | The cleaning lady in our room was not very good. Every day the stuff of our girl were spread around all the room, never tidy or in order. My shoes every time under the bed and almost not cleaned the room. | We hope the management will take into consideration all these facts and will spend more time with training of the staff","Budapest, Hungary",10/29/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Perfect!,"I would firstly like to thank the staff especially Luke for helping my partner surprise me over the weekend. It was my 30th birthday and my partner was planning on proposing. He made the hotel aware and Luke immediately helped in making our stay even better. Upgrading us to the suite as our first surprise,arriving back to the room with a complimentary bottle,candles lit on the balcony and in the bathroom also a hand written note from Luke himself wishing us a fab stay. So thank you Luke and of course I said YES!!!! | Upon arriving in the hotel check in was fast and we were shown to our room. Have to say it's a lovely cool atmosphere almost like we're all friends the minute we arrived! Nothing would be too much trouble if we asked. | The room was simply amazing,spoilt for choice with 2 balconies to sit and watch the boats go by on the Thames. The bed was so comfortable,my head literally sank into the pillows and I was asleep. Absolutely spotlessly clean. Mini bar stocked with everything you may need for an enjoyable evening and I mean everything ;) | Location was perfect for us,a lovely stroll down to the London Eye then on to other attractions. We did everything on foot from the hotel including london eye,ripleys,theatre,Buckingham palace etc. | Would I recommend this hotel to others? Without doubt I haven't stopped talking about it. The Mondrian will be our first choice whenever we are in London again. | The staff are a credit to you so thank you",NA,4/21/2015
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",3,Great location... but!,"Having stayed in other Mandarin Orientals in my time, to be honest this was a little disappointing, bearing in mind the star rating. to start with the positives, the staff were all very welcoming and courteous. nice sized room, great bar, fantastic location for central London. BUT. the furniture was a little knocked and tired looking, there also wasn't any communal lounge area to talk about, so if your meeting people there really isn't anywhere unless you go to the bar, which is noisy. Another bug bear of mine is that you have to pay for the use of the internet, which in this day and age is absurd; it seems the larger hotels feel that they have the right to charge for this service, where as in smaller hotels its free,","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",1/14/2014
The Dorchester,5,Very Luxurious Hotel right in the heart of London,"My husband went to London for business and i and our then 11 month old son accompanied him. We stayed a total of 3 weeks at the Dorchester. | First impression of the Dorchester is already superb. The valet and concierge staff are very alert and helpful. The service is impressive. And most of all i love the way the hotel is very baby/child-friendly. During booking we had requested for a cot, a microwave, a highchair, a baby bath tub to be provided and upon check-in not only were these items available, plus more. They have baby toiletries as well. Traveled extensively with our son and had never encountered such baby friendly hotel service with all their amenities. | Didnt get a chance to try their restaurants but loved the room service menu. Especially the Kabsa and Chicken Curry. | Location wise, I especially loved the location of the Dorchester in Park Lane. It is walking distance to all the tourist spots, the parks and the shopping centres. Hyde Park, St. James' Park, Buckingham Palace, Oxford Street and many more are all within walking distance. I enjoyed walking out everyday with my 11 month old son taking his pram with me and just loved the places we can go that are so near. | Would definitely be back to stay in this hotel again.","Singapore, Singapore",11/15/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Easter Weekend Break,"I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel over the Easter weekend. | The staff were excellent and nothing was to much of a bother for them, in the fact that I had a 60m 850ton Crane parked right outside the hotel...... | Room upgraded and the shower was amazing and the bed very comfortable. | Would I stay at the hotel again, is a massive yes.","Greater London, United Kingdom",4/9/2015
The Rembrandt,4,Comfortable traditional hotel in great location,"Good breakfast and bar/ seating area. My room was light and looked over trees to Victoria and Albert Museum. Big bathroom and room 637 good size for solo traveller. Excellent staff. Recommended for business or leisure. Fantastic location near museums and cafes/restaurants. Highly recommend Orsini, a good trad Italian | almost next door.","Adelaide, Australia",5/29/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,3,Let down! A quirky 3* at most!,"My husband and I stayed at the Mondrian Hotel last weekend, after purchasing a Superior room at a special offer price via Secret Escapes for my birthday treat and unbeknown to me, he had emailed the hotel to let them know it was a birthday celebration. However, unlike the numerous guests who enjoyed wine, cake and cards delivered to their rooms in acknowledgement of the celebration, he didnt even get a reply to his email and not a sign of recognition of my birthday in all the time we stayed | . | Nonetheless, we had high expectations of this new Luxury hotel which opened its doors on 30th September this year, based in a fabulous location by the River particularly after the all hype and promotional material we had read. | When we arrived we noted that the outside still had a lot of building works going on, and my first thought was, we better not be looking out onto any of that scaffolding! We were greeted by a friendly member of staff who asked us to queue at reception where we would be checked in. This didnt take long and we were then escorted to our room which was on the 11th floor, whilst along the way the young guide chatted to us pointing out the various areas of the hotel. | When we stepped into our room we held our breath for the panoramic view of London city as promised on their own website  ""All Superior rooms feature queen or king beds, custom designed dimmable lighting, bespoke furniture and stunning marble bathrooms indicative of Hollywood Glamour, complete with MALIN+GOETZ amenities. Superior rooms also boast some of the hotel's best London views""  well, the hotel wasnt full but we had a horrible view of a couple of high rise office blocks just outside the window (see the photo we took). | The good bits about the room was the comfortable bed (albeit small  we must have had the queen size rather than king) and the bedding was new and fresh  thanks heavens we were going to get a decent nights sleep! Plenty of lighting and the TV which was mounted on the wall was pretty big. Actually, it was mounted too close to the bed so a little uncomfortable to watch  not enough thought given to the layout. The lighting all round was in your face and way too intense, we ended up having to switch it off completely because even dimmed right down was still much too bright. | The clothes hanging area (wardrobe) closed with a curtain on a pole, a reflection of the furniture and fittings which are all pretty cheap and tacky and it wont be long before it starts to look shabby. Attempts at dramatic effects have been made with low-cost materials and it shows. | The bathroom had a nice shower area, although when in use, the water leaks onto the bathroom floor unless you remember to butt the towel right up to the entrance, and the inch high step between the bathroom and bedroom has you stubbing your toe each time you walk in and out. | The toiletries are generous but not luxurious, very mediocre. | | The tea tray included 2 large mugs and a kettle, also some small sachets of really rank fair-trade instant coffee, sugar sachets and two teabags  really, what a poor effort, why bother? For a moment I thought we were in a Travelodge! Prices of anything on the room menu however, were very much indicative of a 5 star hotel! | The room telephone didnt work because it needed to charge! | Buffet breakfast was included in the price the next day and we made our way to the restaurant which wasnt busy although there were more than enough staff milling about. We were given a menu when we registered our names and room number before sitting down. A choice of anything from the table including cereals, fruit, yogurt, cheeses and ham, toast etc. and then either two eggs, bacon and eggs or sausage and eggs. Condiments on the table included a small open dish with salt flakes (how unhygienic!) and I had to grab a pepper grinder from another table. You could have your eggs any style and although we chose scrambled, I think they had started out as an omelette and were stirred at the last minute. It was probably one of the worst breakfasts we've eaten in a London hotel although thankfully the coffee was much better than the instant rubbish offered in the rooms and I imagine the River view from the restaurant would be absolutely stunning on a hot summers day with the bi-fold doors open. The furniture in the Restaurant again was very cheap looking and uncomfortable to sit for too long. | Summing up this hotel - its in a good location - the favourite areas like Covent Garden, Theatre land etc are close by, its new and the staff are friendly and eager - it would naturally appeal to the younger crowds. A huge effort has been made in promoting it but our own experience was very disappointing, we've stayed in some fabulous 5* hotels all over London and by comparison, this one doesn't even come close. | I can't imagine it ever reaching luxury standard not even when all the teething problems have been ironed out and would rate it as a quirky 3* and not to everyones taste by any means. One nights stay was more than enough for us; sadly we wont be rushing back to visit that particular establishment again.",Oxford,10/28/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Brilliant find,Superb all round. | Views over the Thames were second to none. Easy access onto the South Bank. | Staff friendly and professional without being over bearing. | Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. found mini bar prices a bit on the excessive side along with the price for breakfast. | | |,"Barnsley, United Kingdom",9/7/2015
The Dorchester,5,Excellant,"We stayed at the Dorchester for the first time,we usually stay at The Savoy ,it was a excellent stay and we really enjoyed the fantastic service and suite we had. | We will visit again in the very near future. | The service for afternoon tea and in the French restraunt was fantastic.","Telford, United Kingdom",9/28/2014
The Rembrandt,5,"Excellent location, comfortable, well-managed, good value","We enjoyed a two night stay in the Rembrandt. The location is excellent for leisure visitors  opposite the V and A and close to Londons museum quarter, much of its fashionable shopping and many good restaurants. There is a bus stop outside the door and its a just a four minute walk to a three-line Underground station (South Kensington) with a direct link to Heathrow and good connections to Gatwick and Stansted. | The décor of the public areas is traditional and undistinguished. Room size varies and our standard room was one of the smaller ones on our floor. However, it and its bathroom were adequately sized in context and very well-equipped. The lighting was unusually good. We had a view over neighbouring back gardens and no noise. | The atmosphere and the seating in the breakfast room were somewhat industrial but the buffet was well-stocked and of good quality and the staff were attentive. | Theres a fully serviced front desk, concierge and porter service, with helpful and pleasant staff. WiFi access is uncomplicated and free throughout the hotel. | We thought our pre-paid room rate of c. $330 per night including a full breakfast was good value by local standards. | The Rembrandt doesnt do high end luxury and is more a base than a destination. But its a comfortable, well-managed and straightforward four-star property. Recommended.","Dublin, Ireland",11/8/2013
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Excellent in every way,"Had a great stay last weekend to celebrate my partners birthday. Thanks Luke and others who did everything to make it extra special. Loved the views, bed to die for, etc, etc. Staff recruitment process is impressive - all staff came across as genuinely wanting to help and friendly.","Stockholm, Sweden",4/3/2015
The Savoy,5,Luxurious,My partner and I stayed here for one night for a significant birthday treat for myself. We started with afternoon tea which was something else - tea by the gallon and the food excellent. Our room in the Edwardian Wing was lovely with a partial view of the Thames. My birthday was celebrated by cake in the room and also at tea. | This makes it sound ordinary but it was far from that - the service was superb and the staff so friendly and chatty and they made us feel very special in an unobtrusive way. Checking in was delightful as was the checking out. The situation of the hotel is great - just a quick stroll to Leicester Square and Covent Garden. | As it was a special occasion I don't expect we could afford to stay for a long time but my 24/48 hours in this hotel will remain with me forever. Thank you the Savoy.,london,12/5/2013
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Incredible Place,"I was so stressed trying to find a place to stay in London for a trip I knew I wanted to eat relax and explore and finally just picked the Mondrian. A lot cheaper than the other nice hotels around but an amazing location (I walked everywhere), amazing food, and very comfortable rooms. Would definitely recommend for anyone wanting to explore London for a few days!","Bagamoyo, Tanzania",11/14/2017
The Savoy,5,A Cut Above the Rest,"Or, it is how I imagine what being treated like Royalty would be like because service at The Savoy is second to none. From the moment you walk in you get the feeling there is nothing, well, within reason, they wont do to make your stay memorable. | You are greeted at the door by an elegantly appointed doorman and quickly relieved of your luggage. I guess you could hang on to your stuff but I get the feeling that would disrupt the smooth flow of the check-in process. Dont worry, you will meet up with it again later. You will be lead to a personal consultation with the guest representative where the details of your stay will be reviewed and all the burdensome documentation will be quickly dispatched. I had arrived before noon so was most pleasantly surprised to learn that the room was ready. Katarina did a fantastic job with all the administrative functions and then escorted me to my room in one of the more private wings of the hotel. A few minutes later Martin showed up with my bag. I could swear he offered to unpack for me but unaccustomed to that level of service, I deferred. | The Luxury King room was located across from the elevator which had me a bit concerned but the room was very quiet, never heard a thing from the hallway. It helps that the room has a small foyer that separates the bathroom from the bedroom (see photo) and you can shut the bedroom door if necessary. The room had a nice view of the river if you looked over the adjoining rooftops but not too bad really. The room was equipped with a large Loewe TV, a brand I had never heard of but now understand that it is a high-quality set. Wi-Fi was adequate in the room but I had to re-login every time my phone would go into sleep mode. But then maybe it was just me. | I had booked the Savoy breakfast option but that process really confused me. Breakfast is available in either the Foyer or Kaspars Seafood Bar and breakfast selections are all off an À la carte menu. The wait staff will take your order and when finished you charge the breakfast to your room. I never saw any additional charges on my room bill so I assumed the breakfast was covered by the pre-paid breakfast option. Besides that, was very satisfied with the quality of the food and the service. | Pricy hotel but greatness is not cheap and in this case, you get what you pay for. Worth it just for the experience.",Texas,4/5/2017
Rhodes Hotel,5,Wonderful hospitality and impeccable cleanliness,"My son and I stayed for some time at the Rhodes hotel in London during our recent holiday to the UK. I did not really know what to expect but we were warmly welcomed and made to feel like family during our stay. Chris is larger than life and Maria is a beautiful person. We felt truly at home during our total of more than two weeks overall at the Rhodes. It is at a very convenient location near both Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations. The beds are very comfortable which is much appreciated after a full day touring around London, and many of the bathrooms are wonderful. Chris and Maria have gone out of their way to ensure that the hotel has good, clean, and comfortable accommodation for visitors to London. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to all my friends and relations wanting to stay a while in London, and I fully intend to return. Thank you Chris and Maria.",Gold Coast,6/1/2009
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Erholsame Tage in London,"Sehr gute Lage, im Zentrum. In der Nähe zum Travalgar Square und zum Charing Cross Bahnhof. Auch die Embankment Underground Station ist nur um die Ecke. Wunderschöne Lobby mit sensationellen Blumensträusse! Gute Auswahl an Restaurants und Bars. Auch ein herrliches Spa. Schöne Zimmer mit jeglichen Komfort. Schnelles Internet. Schönes Badezimmer mit separater Badewanne und Dusche. Guter Zimmerservice, feines Essen. Ich würde dieses Hotel wieder wählen!",NA,8/23/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,4,Very nice hotel with fantastic spa facilities,"I stayed here one night with my sister. It took us a little time to find the entrance, as there is an entrance to a (very popular) hotel bar on the opposite side of the building to the hotel reception which we got a little muddled by. | The room was luxurious and spotlessly clean, but a little smaller than I had imagined (compared to other 5* stars, like the Savoy), however, we were in a corner room which may have been the reason why, The facilities in the room were great though - the bathroom had a luxury shower with an overhead 'rain' effect and a bath complete with TV! There was also a Nespresso machine and a full size hairdryer which I appreciated. | The highlight of the hotel for us without a doubt though was the spa facilities, which were gorgeous and a real treat, complete with a number of jacuzzi jets, large sauna, steam room and pool. The staff in the spa were very helpful too. | Final plus of this hotel is the position which is great for most theatres, accesible to Southbank and a short walk from the Parks. All in all a very nice hotel,",London,1/3/2012
The Savoy,5,Wonderful indulgence!,"Even the most jaded and world-weary of travellers would struggle not to be bowled over by the romance of sensational river views from the luxurious decadence of a truly sumptious, cavernous bed. The Savoy's glamorous history adds to the sense of occasion already created by the combination of superbly attentive staff and almost outrageous opulence. We combined an over-night stay with tickets to the Royal Opera House for a very special treat, a perfect match of culture and indulgence.","London, United Kingdom",5/26/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Ottimo soggiorno,"L albergo si trova leggermente fuori dalla zona centrale di Londra ma comunque a 12 minuti a piedi da Saint Paul e dal London eye. La struttura ha inaugurato pochi mesi fa ed è quindi in perfetto stato. Le zone comuni sono ampie e di un design fresco e moderno. Il bar all'ultimo piano è' già hotspot di Londra ed è vivo tutte le sere della settimana. La spa e' un po piccola e i servizi sono limitati ad un bagno turco ma i trattamenti offerti sono molti e lo staff molto professionale. Le camere sono in linea con quelle dell catena, quelle standard tendenzialmente piccole ma estremamente carine e ben disegnate, mentre quelle di categorie più alte ampie e sofisticate. Ho alloggiato sia in una deluxe sia in una suite vista fiume e mi sono trovato molto bene in entrambi i casi. Lo staff e' giovane ma esperto e cortese. Lo consiglio sicuramente.","Geneva, Switzerland",5/15/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Fantastic,"The Corinthia is a beautiful hotel that is in a fantastic location. We had a gorgeous room with all the luxury you would hope for from a 5 star hotel. Considering the size of the hotel it has retained a homely feel. We ate breakfast in the Northall which was excellent.. They had everything you could want. We had cocktails in the Garden room which was sublime.. The fires were lit and had a lovely romantic feel. We also had drinks in the Massimo bar which again was lovely. The Spa was most definitely a highlight for us. It is huge and beautifully designed. The only down side is that children are allowed in the pool which is fine if they are encouraged to respect that people are there to relax. Sadly two children were extremely noisy, running about and jumping in and we didn't feel we could use the pool which spoilt the ambience the hotel had clearly worked very hard to create. But it didn't spoil our enjoyment and we can't wait to go back.","Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom",1/2/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Sehr stylisches Hotel in perfekter Lage,"Um es gleich vorwegzunehmen - selbst für Londoner Verhältnisse ist das Corinthia nicht günstig. Aber es ist seinen Preis wert. Das ganze Hotel ist sehr stylisch und superschön eingerichtet. Der Concierge schafft es sogar, für den nächsten Tag Wimbledon-Tickets zu besorgen (konnte Centurion nicht). Das Frühstück ist sehr gut und auch das Abendessen im Restaurant hat uns gut gefallen. Wenn ich überhaupt etwas monieren muss, könnte ich nur sagen, dass der Spa für meinen Geschmack etwas dunkel ist, das wäre dann schon alles. Alles in Allem - sehr empfehlenswert!","Munich, Germany",8/24/2015
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Lovely hotel,"We stayed for a couple of nights and the hotel is lovely! We had a complementary upgrade - our room was clean, spacious and quiet. All the toiletries are Elemis and our room had a lovely deep bath and walk in shower. | Location is good too- about 5 minutes from Moorgate on he northern line, so easy to get to Euston/kings cross and 5 minutes the other way to Bank in central line. As it's in the financial district and off a main road, it's very quiet at the weekend. I wouldn't stay there on my own as there's no one really about when you walk back to hotel later at night. | Breakfast was really nice too!",NA,8/7/2017
The Rembrandt,5,Fabulous,I booked this hotel to have a mini break with my mother. We were upgraded to a club room on arrival and the check in was easy. The room was beautiful with sumptuous décor. Everything matched and you knew that money had had been spent in ensuring a luxurious stay. Spotlessly clean and very comfortable beds. We had breakfast included in our stay and the dining room was lovely. A wonderful choice of food with good service. Would definitely stay here again.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",2/10/2014
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,What a perfect weekend!,"My wife and I wanted a romantic weekend in a luxurious room away from our kids. We actually live in London anyway but we don't want to drive for ages out of London on a Friday night so we tend to look for top quality, luxury hotel deals that include breakfast and dinner. This hotel is in the heart of the financial district of London so is completely quiet during the weekends. If you want to wander around you can always head over to Spitalfields market where there is lots to see and do. | Anyway, the staff from reception to kitchen to housekeeping were delightful, all ready to help. Our room was an apartment (nice surprise) with two intertwined towel swans on the bed with rose petals scattered around! Unbelievable. The breakfast was perfect and the dinner in the evening was lovely too. Admittedly on the Friday evening the bar/restaurant was heaving with city workers who spilled out onto the pavement, having a drink before going home, but hey, give them a break, they were just unwinding and were gone later in the evening. From Saturday morning onwards it was quiet and peaceful. | Now before you think I'm making this up I will say the a/c blew a little cold so we turned it off but I'm sure that was something they could fix if we had asked but to be honest we just snuggled down deeper under the duvet...... | We will definitely be back when the winter months draw in and the kids want a weekend to themselves. We love this hotel and the staff!","London, United Kingdom",9/22/2014
Corinthia Hotel London,5,"Comfortable rooms, Excellent restaurants, incomparable service","If I were a hotel manager, I would hate to have a guest like me. I have exceedingly high - perhaps impossible - expectations about comfort, cleanliness, courtesy, and prompt service. Unfortunately, I usually have to compromise on my standards, because most hotels simply cannot live up to them. There is one exception. The Corinthian in London. It is the finest hotel I've ever stayed at. The rooms are tastefully furnished, the Wifi is excellent, the room service is outstanding, the restaurants have an excellent menu and a terrific wait staff. For people who like to walk the location is excellent. For those who prefer transportation, a cab stand is right outside the hotel But what makes the hotel non pareil is the staff. Imagine a hotel where every member of the staff acts as if he or she is an owner and you are a cherished guest. That's how you'll feel from the moment you enter. And you'll continue to feel that way throughout your stay. I have stayed in hotels from Tel Aviv to Istanbul, from Boston to Berlin, from New York to Rio. When I visit New York I stay at one of the best hotels in the nation, but nothing and I mean nothing has ever equalled the experience I had at the Corinthia Hotel in London. I recommend it unequivocally and enthusiastically. And after you stay there, I can almost guarantee that you will too.","Coral Gables, Florida",1/7/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Amazing!,"went here for a spa day with a friend! What an amazing experience! The interior was contemporary and very posh!! Glass walls, chandeliers simply beautiful! | They had a huge steam and sauna room which was simply the best steam and sauna i have seen! | The sleep pods were blissful! Very quiet. | Refreshments every where to rehydrate! | Heated loungers to relax after using the spa facilities! | The treatments were amazing too! Very professional and very relaxing! In fact i fell asleep! | Went for lunch, which was light and delicious.

The Savoy,5,True British Heritage Experience,"Hotel is centrally located next to the river Thames accessible to London's historical places, shopping centers and theatres. This hotel gives a royal ambience with classic old interiors. Rooms are really spacious and comfortable. Washroom are large and newly furnished. The Thames Foyer with natural light and glass domes where the breakfast and afternoon tea is served, is the central attraction of the hotel. Their concierge services are outstanding.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,<U+2765><U+266A><U+266B>¸¸.<U+2606>¨A place to play like a pirate!,"Had a fun overnight stay for husband's birthday to meet friends in the hotel for dinner and drinks. | Check-in was very slow when we arrived but finally the (very charming) cavalry arrived and we were very kindly upgraded from a standard room to a superior, which had a partial river and city view and were also given a drinks voucher for the birthday boy. | If you are a fan of design led interiors, this Tom Dixon creation is fabulous. The Dandelyan, Sea Containers restaurant and Rumpus room all have their own vibe yet with repeated elements that tie the whole together around the copper ship's hull reception area. | Loved the subtle nautical styled charcoal cabinetry with magenta interiors in the room. There were two lush chairs, an iron and ironing board in the spacious hidden closet, an illuminated mirror, wifi, media hub, desk, well stocked mini bar, decent hairdryer, excellent lighting and a king bed with good clearance either side, all punctuated with quirky styling pieces. | The bathroom is indulgent, with a walk in marble tiled shower with a fantastic rain head shower and quality toiletries, although no robes, rum soap anyone? | The hotel, a hip happening destination in itself with views to St Paul's, is close to all the great attractions of the South Bank where there are things going on year round and it's a pleasant walk in good weather with an overnight bag from London Bridge or Blackfriars. | I'd recommend the bars, restaurant and hotel, the friendly service throughout is very attentive, (Andrea in Sea Containers, take a bow) but if you're eating or drinking here although fab, beware that the amazing view costs, the prices are already sky high and 20% service is automatically added which can be a bit of a shock if you're not accustomed to it! | <U+2765><U+266A><U+266B>¸¸.<U+2606>¨",Australia & London UK,11/28/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Birthday Celebration,"My wife and I were joined by 22 close friends to celebrate her birthday last Saturday - a great evening. | We assembled in a reserved area called the Upper Deck of the Dandelyan Bar for pre-dinner Champagne and nibbles - the service was attentive and although moving space was limited there was enough seating for all. The views across the river as dusk fell were awesome and, as the tide was full when we arrived, watching the river traffic made all realise who busy the Thames is. | Following a couple of hours chatting and catching up we moved across to the Sea Containers Restaurant and were seated on two tables on the far side where there were great views across the river, St Paul's etc.. We ate from a ""Feast"" menu with additional 'bread' as this appeared to be the most hassle free option. A good option as it turned out, Sea Bass and Chicken formed the main meat dish (both were excellent) and these followed some great starters and were followed by good puddings. There were no problems with catering for any allergy sufferers and once again the service was faultless. | We, and our guests, all really enjoyed our evening and will return.",NA,11/18/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,4,Do you need 5 stars to charge £6.50 for a cup of tea?,"The hotel furnishing were amazing. The bedroom was a very high standard, and in some ways too perfect. It almost felt like there was staff on call anytime. I have never seen a bathroom so luxurious, with a TV in the bathroom and water tight control. | I had afternoon tea and a friend just wanted tea at £6.5o. Tea is 95% water, so you are paying this amount for a tea bag! And the afternoon tea i would not take again,( the cakes were like plastic) its better going somewhere else. | The breakfast I've seen better at a lower star in the Tower Bridge area. | Overall great location, but its almost trying too much ( even the smiles) they need to relax, maybe they should book in themselves",Darwen,11/7/2011
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Very comfortable stay,"I was in London for a couple of days on business and was put up at the Apex London Wall Hotel. It was perfect for my needs. Very comfortable, discrete but attentive and friendly service from the staff, clean and looked good to boot. The location is great for the City, being located about 5 mins walk from Liverpool St Station, and just off London Wall, although the fact it is on a side street means it is a little quieter as it is removed from the hustle and bustle.","George Town, Cayman Islands",8/19/2013
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Brilliant atay,"Our plane arrived in London at 9:30am, unfortunately when we got to the hotel our room wasnt ready but we were able to store our luggage and go downstairs to freshen up before going shopping for the day. We returned in the afternoon tired and with sore feet, only to be greeted with a glass of bubbles and were told our luggage is already in our room, and we were given a voucher to use in the hotel which was a lovely touch. Room was very nice, great shower and comfortable beds. You can tell they have really thought a lot of things through. The hotel is no fuss and runs like a well oiled machine, and fantastic value too. I would definitely stay again and would recommend to a friend.",NA,5/9/2018
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Quintessential luxury London hotel,"This hotel is pure class and sumptuous luxury. The staff are wonderful and the rooms understated beauty and luxury.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,FORMIDABLE EXPERIENCE IN THE RIVER VIEW SUITE!,"Soooo, my boyfriend and i had the pleasure of returning to the hotel for a night and staying in the river view suite. On arrival we were greeted by a warm young lady who checked us in and recommended we have dinner at Sea Containers restaurant (you MUST TRY THE LAMB! simply divine btw). The suite had AMAZING RIVER VIEWS! It was a breathtaking view especially at night as it had two balconies! One in the living space and one in the bedroom. I love the open layout of the suite as it makes the design and space fluid, no doors separating the living space from the bedroom just gives the feeling of a super modern luxe apartment. | We slept soundly with no disturbances and were woken up at the time we had specified the night before to have breakfast. The breakfast spread we ordered was yummy ( eggs, sausages, waffles, fresh juices- YES I KNOW WE ORDERED A LOT). | Right before we checked out i made sure to have a nice warm bath in what was a beautiful tub in the bathroom. | We were checked out by a lovely lady who had an american accent as well as wit (i really wish i could remember her name she was so sweet). | Needless to say, revisiting the hotel","London, United Kingdom",10/10/2015
The Rembrandt,4,Great place to stay when visiting Kensington area,"Stayed a few times over the last few years and enjoyed every visit. Well priced, great amenities and some old world courtesy and service like valet parking of car nearby, door man who is helpful, concierge who knows answers to everything you happen to ask, swimming pool available. Rooms great and comfortable and quite luxurious. Fantastic breakfasts.",Alston,1/27/2018
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,3,"great public areas, trendy but service not great","For me, this wasn't a five star hotel. Check in was brisk but no one offered to take our bags to our room or even show us where it was or where the lifts were. Our room was a disabled one, I presume, as I'd asked to have a room that adjoined our (grown up) sons. That was fine except the shaving mirror was at hip height and placed for some strange reason in front of the sink so you couldn't reach the sink properly and when I put make up on I had to do it on my knees! We only had one dressing gown and one bottle of water even though there were two of us staying. The aircon was noisy and woke me up. The view from our room was straight into a load of offices. | Having said that, the public areas in the hotel, bars, etc were great, interesting and fun. | It was let down badly by the lack of service though. When we checked out we asked if we could pick up our bags later (yes) so we'd left them in our room as we normally do. We were asked to go and fetch them and bring them to the reception, which I refused to do. It was things like this that let it down.",cornwall,12/3/2015

The Dorchester,5,Worth every penny,"I am not in the habit of staying in such luxerious places, but through a combination of a special offer and a 50th birthday, the opportunity finally presented itself. | Was it worth it? | I must say that it was worth every penny. The luxury and relaxed charm was evident everywhere and unlike other grand London Hotels, everything was very bright and beautiful. | The staff were brilliant and there was a total lack of snobbery that made you feel very welcome no matter what your personal circumstances were. | Breakfast was faultless and the bed was the largest and the most comfortable that i have ever stayed in. | There was one very small criticism. Despite the price of the room, there is no complimentary tea/coffee facilities in the room. We had to fill our boots with extra tea at Breakfast.","Leicester, United Kingdom",11/22/2011
Corinthia Hotel London,4,Flash Hotel in London,We staid 3 nights at the Corinthia Hotel. The rooms are very well equipped and luxurious. We only had dinner once at the Northhall restaurant. The food was good but expensive like most places in London. The supporting staff were helpful and nice. Some of the restaurant staff were quite snotty and pompous. We had a complimentary car to the airport and the driver was most courteous and helpful.,"Jakarta, Indonesia",10/15/2016

Corinthia Hotel London,5,Family trip,Spend 4 days in London with the kids. Fantastic hotel and very gentle staff. Can't say a bad word.

Great pool and spa facilities. Superb,Brussels,8/24/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,4,Good all round hotel,"I've stayed here many times now and its a very good hotel. | Rooms are large and very comfortable with excellent service from all the staff. | It has a great bar with super service, | The main public areas are smart and welcoming. | The breakfast area is ok, its more like a smart French bistro and the food is generally very good. | Location wise again its ok but its not in Mayfair but if your a tourist then its not that bad close to trafalger square. | It really depends on your room rate, personally if your paying full rates and you had the choice of Claridges, the Savoy or the Connaught then I'd rather stay in these because of the location or the ambiance. However the Corinthia is a very good hotel overall and you will enjoy staying here.",UK,2/10/2013
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",5,You really cannot fault this place apart from 1 thing,"First thing I have to mention is this hotel has in my opinion the best staff of any hotel I have ever stayed at , incredible service levels , the rooms although large are beautiful and well equipped , we stayed in room 403 the Charlie Chaplin suite and what a beautiful room , again fantastic sign in and great room tour , we even had a lift by the hotels rolls Royce to the meal we had booked in central London , my only fault and it's minor is the bar area is to small , I know it's a small thing but sometimes my wife and daughter like to sit for a hour and and a drink and read but I felt we were crammed in really and not ideal for relaxing , overall though loved this place and yes I will be back","London, United Kingdom",12/11/2016
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,The little things.,"A great hotel in a superb location goes without saying. So why so good? The Italian Nectarines in our room were just sensational!! And the continental Healthy breakfast was as good as it gets, first class quality and just fantastic. | But one big question? When you have such a great hotel and experience why in this day and age do you have to pay for Internet access? Surely wireless is part of the expectation these days particularly in a 5 star hotel. The staff embarrassing told me it was not the hotel policy and I would suggest that this was not the first time this issue had been raised. Apart from the lack of Free wireless a great hotel.","Newcastle, Australia",9/11/2013
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Perfect Dinner with great view,"We went to the Mondrian with a group of 10 people. Laura Giacomo from the staff organised everything for us in a perfect way.

The Rembrandt,4,Excellent Location,"500 yards from Harrods and close to museums and the underground this hotel is very well situated for a sightseeing trip to the capitol. | But its not just the location that makes this hotel worth staying at,the excellent rooms and comfortable beds all add up to a great stay,and all this is rounded off with a first class breakfast,full english,continental,cereals,tea,coffee,fruit juice are all there for you to choose from. | I can highly reccommend this hotel for an affordable taste of the good living.","Cardiff, United Kingdom",10/19/2012
The Dorchester,5,Great hotel to stay in,"My wife and I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Dorchester. While not the cheapest hotel in London, it is certainly one of the best. The hotel mixes tradition well with modern touches to ensure that there is a unique identity which isn't lacking the facilities you would expect in a modern hotel. | The staff were friendly and excellent, despite it being a hotel frequented by celebrities and VIP's we were never made to feel second rate even if we were walking around in daggy clothes in the British heat. | The breakfast is top notch and the bar makes very good martini's. All round pleasure",Melbourne,7/28/2013

The Savoy,5,1st Class,"After eating at The Savoy Grill a couple of years ago I decided to stay over night as a joint birthday celebration with my wife. It was everything we expected and more, a truly excellent experiance that should be done at least once. We booked Kasper's restaurant in the hotel for a pre theatre dinner which was extremely good value for money considering where you were. We later drank in the Beaufort Bar enjoying the fabulious cocktails on offer. As it was a joint birthday trip the hotel had placed an excuisit piece of cake and two plates in our room when we arrived, a really nice touch. All the staff were extremely polite and professional at every stage of the stay from the welcome upon arrival to the farewell when we left. This is without doubt the best hotel experience I have ever had and worth every penny, we will be back!","Northampton, United Kingdom",1/26/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Second time visiting,"Honestly the Mondrian hotel is one of my favourite places to stay ever since I found it a few months ago. The price is perfect for the service and facilities you have access to. | We arrived on a Friday and spent a few hours in the spa, although I couldn't have my spa treatment (due to personal reasons) the receptionist was kind enough to cancel my appointment without charge. My partner had his treatment and claims that the treatment has come close to his favourite spa treatment which he had at Espa Spa (Corinthia). | What made us come back was the faultless customer service and the quirky interior. | We hope to come visit again in a few months!","London, United Kingdom",9/14/2015
The Rembrandt,4,One night business stay,"I stayed in the hotel for one night for a business trip. I had looked at the hotel online before I visited and was suitably impressed. On arrival, there was a very large queue to check-in as there were several conferences going on at the same time. The reception team tried their best to move the queue along quickly. | The conference facilities were good and the food provided was plenty, and delicious. I had one evening meal, two lunches and one breakfast. All were buffet style. | The bedroom had a good view of the old buildings opposite which was nice. I was a little disappointed with the room itself - it looked quite tired and not like the images on the website. The bed was comfy and it was clean. The organisers of the event I travelled for paid for the hotel but if I was going to London on a personal trip, I'm not sure I'd stay here for the price it is. | The location is good - just down the road from Harrods.","Liverpool, United Kingdom",10/4/2018
The Rembrandt,3,"As average as it gets, except for the breakfast!","This hotel was absolutely average in every way. The room was fine, loud, but fine. The service was decent, decor was nothing to write home about. We had a few issues with the U.S. outlet and the internet, but they were quickly resolved. The breakfast that was included in our package was really outstanding, however, which made this worth our while. The location was great too...just a short walk to the underground and lots of places to grab dinner and drinks in the area. We used to hotel bar a few nights are were generally happy with the service and drinks there as well. | Stay here if you can get a good rate that includes breakfast, and you are going to be sightseeing all day anyway. That is what we did and were happy. We just needed a place to rest our heads, and this was it.",Chicago,8/24/2010
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Enjoyable and comfortable stay.,"My wife and I stayed here for one night in mid-December. We found the situation was close enough to the city to get to places like Oxford Street and Convent Garden, but far enough away to not be overly busy. When we checked in, we were served by a very polite and helpful young man at reception who told us everything we needed to know. The room was spacious and comfortable, and even though we hadn't asked for a river-view room, we could still see many of the landmarks such as St Pauls and the Shard. We didn't have our evening meal there, but breakfast was excellent, with an array of top quality food, and again the service was top notch.","Suffolk, United Kingdom",12/26/2015
The Rembrandt,5,"Ideally located, a special place in London.","The location is excellent, across the road from my favourite museum, the V&amp;A. Quiet, well run, excellent value for London, and comfortable. I booked an executive double for single use and found the room both spacious and extremely functional with extra mirrors in the bedroom (so many hotels have only one mirror and that will be in the bathroom), a well-designed bathroom with a non-slip floor (important to an elderly traveller) and last but not least, the best quality toilet paper encountered in Europe! The good quality toiletries were also appreciated. Breakfast was excellent with lots of fresh fruit on offer as well as a very wide range of other food options both hot and cold. My only negative comment is that both the bed and pillows in that particular room need replacing and as the hotel is undergoing renovations no doubt this will happen in due course. On my next visit to London I will certainly be requesting accommodation at The Rembrandt.","Hobart, Australia",1/16/2015
London Guest House,3,In London you get what you pay for.,"Found the staff very polite and helpful nothing was a problem. Rooms not too spacious but clean and given we stayed when London was experiencing sub zero temps very warm. | This is a B&amp;B hotel so no frills - you are restricted to your room once in the building. | Breakfast was help yourself to cereals bread fruit etc no full English. | Fairly near to the Tube and main line services into city. | You would not want to spend a week here as no real comfort area to relax in, | Cheap and cheerful is expression to best describe this venue. | Would recommend with warning don't expect too much.","Carlisle, United Kingdom",12/2/2010

The Savoy,5,Beaufort Bar is Big City magic . . .,"The Beaufort is what makes living in a capital city worthwhile. Walk through the famous black- and-white tiled lobby and on down the stairs to the central lounge area, where visitors still happily enjoy afternoon tea at 7.30, and you know you're 'not in Kansas anymore'. Or anywhere you've been before. Check out the generous spread of the chairs, for instance, an unerring sign of genuine hospitality and customer-led design. | On your left is The Beaufort Bar. It's as dark and moody, chic and shiny, comfortable and cosseting as you'd ever want. It's great to know it's been worth the trouble to dress up - even though there's a more casual dress code these days, you'll never be overdressed at The Beaufort. | You can take if for granted there's a tremendous range of cocktails and a choice of champagnes by the glass that is truly breathtaking. It's somewhow extra zingy to drink a gin and tonic in an ambiance where a glass of champagne can cost up to £75. I asked for my new favourite, a Hoffman Martini (gin, very little Vermouth and a couple of dashes of Orange Bitters; and when we discussed which gin, the waitress offered differing twists - grapefruit for Tanqueray 10, until I told her that any customer on statins was likely to be laid dramatically low by grapefruit. Excellent service, and I loved hearing the cocktail shakers over the buzz of happy eaters and drinkers. The only slight irritation was the volume of both piano and soloist but apparently this is being worked on. | We didn't order any but fabulous light meals/snacks were being delivered elsewhere and were then enjoyed with obvious relish. | All in all, The Beaufort is where to go when you want to feel special, are feeling special, wish to feel special or want to make someone else feel special. You are at The Savoy - thus all is well with the world. It's a type of magic that happens only in a Big City.","London, United Kingdom",6/18/2012
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Great place to stay!,"I have stayed in this hotel regularly for years and I've never had a bad experience at this place. | The location is fantastic! The West End is in walking distance and you have a bus station right across the street plus several tube stations less than a 10 minute walk away. | The hotel itself is basic but clean. You can choose between ensuite and basic rooms (toilet and shower to share). The shared facilities are all clean and I've never had to queue to take a shower or use the toilet. | The rooms aren't big but the size is just fine in my opinion. I've never had an issue with any of the rooms I've stayed in (and I've stayed in quite a few different ones over the years). | The staff is always friendly and helpful. Everyone is always happy to assist with whatever question you may have. | You get free Wifi in the whole hotel, English breakfast is included and you can often check into your room as early as 12 which is definitely not the norm in London. | I'd highly recommend this hotel for a city break.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Empfehlenswerte Wohnlage,"Das Sea Container Mondrian ist ein relativ neues ( amerikanisches ) 5-Sterne-Haus am | Südufer der Themse in Southwark.

Das Hotel ist modern gestylt, mit | vielen Designer-gags. Die Gäste und das Restaurant-Publikum sind relativ jung und | geben dem Hotel einen modischen touch. | Unser Zimmer mit Themseblick entsprach in der Größe und Einrichtung etwa dem | ""Hilton-Standard-Zimmer"", nur das ( Dusch-)Bad war etwas großzügiger geschnitten. | Insofern ist der horrende Preis allenfalls durch den Blick auf die Themse zu rechtfer- | tigen.

Die sehr freundliche Bedienungs-Mannschaft aus internationalen | jungen Service-Amateuren versucht, dem Gast über ein ziemlich schlichtes und ( bei | einer Woche ) eintöniges Frühstück hinwegzuhelfen, das mit einem traditionellen | Hilton-Frühstück nicht mithalten kann. | Rezeption und Service werden von äußerst zuvorkommenden jungen Leuten getragen, | sodaß man über Mängel bei üblichen Hotelstandards auf der 5-Sterne-Ebene gerne | hinwegsieht.

The Savoy,5,Mrs,"Tuesday 21st july. 2015, what a magical and wonderful day and once in a life time experience! My husband and I decided that the best way to use our red letter day was to lunch at the Savoy grill. | We found all the staff incredibly attentive without being intrusive. Every dish was absolutely delicious. There was a bit of a delay with our main course and unexpectedly we were served a gazpachio to die for. | Whilst waiting for our dessert we were served another little extra, a chocolate mousse what a treat. | Of course we treated ourselves with a glass of champagne and half a bottle of Nuit St George but we wanted to day to be very special as my husband was still recovering from a long illness. | We owe a special thank you to our smiling and very knowledgeable sommeliere Aurelie, who invited us to visit the kitchens where we found more friendly and welcoming staff. | We will definitely have to find another reason to re- visit the Savoy grill before too long.

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",4,Attention to details in a great location.,"The staff at this hotel go above and beyond and the location is fantastic. | We arrived about 15 min before the posted check in time. we were greeted by smiles, lovely cups of tea and apologies for the room not being ready. | a flurry of activity and voila less than 5 min later we were personally escorted by the check in staff to our room. this was new to me and a nice touch. Normally I have had check in staff give quick dire tions from behind a counter and when the luggage arrives a bellhop explains the room particulars. i like this much better. | we were travelling as a family but on a corporate rate. | the room was older ..it is london afterall.. but spacious and well appointed. | it was clean and fresh with a small entrance area that separated the bathroom from the bedroom. | the additional bed was set up and ready along with lovely bottles of water and lemonade. replenished daily and comimentary. turn down service excellent with special treats for our daughter. | the bellman and doormen were always friendly and eager to assist. | the gym and pool a nice bonus. although acess to a hottub for our young daughter after a dip in the cool lap pool would have been nice. brr.. | this hotel's proximity to the piccadily line, harrods and hyde park make it very special. | opportunities for improvements: | - strong chlorinated smell from water in bathroom | - showerhead would leak excessively about 15 minutes after every use making us feel as though we'd forgot to shut it off | - the children's robe was bizarrely short...but made for a good laugh. | we would stay here again without question.","British Columbia, Canada",8/8/2016

Ridgemount Hotel,4,Friendly and Helpful B&B,"We moved to the Ridgemount Hotel on our second night in London after a horrible experience at another hotel down the street (Gower Hotel). Tried to get in to the Arran House which I'd stayed at before, but they were full. So we came to the Ridgemount on a recommendation from the staff at the Arran House, and we were not disappointed. The small rooms with shared bathrooms were expected from previous stays at London B&amp;Bs. Breakfast each morning in the basement was standard English B&amp;B fare with toast and boiled eggs made to order, and cottage bacon, fruit, and cereal options as well. The older couple running the place were extremely friendly and helpful. We were renting a car to travel west for a week, and the gentleman owner/manager gave us all sorts of helpful tips on how to avoid central London and expensive fees from the traffic cameras on every corner. They also let us store our unneeded luggage until we returned from the countryside excursion. One of the best things about this B&amp;B is the location. They are a hop and a skip away from the British Museum where I spent much of my time. It is also just a jaunt to the Theatre District and a little over a mile walk down the road to Trafalgar Square or Piccadilly Circus. So much to do and see in this part of central London!","Spokane, Washington",4/1/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,5,"Back again, and still loving the Corinthia","We enjoyed our November visit to the Corinthia so much that we returned the end of May. I'm still in love with this place, and do plan to visit again, although we did have one nuisance of a problem. The internet service in our room was very spotty, and mostly did not work. I twice reported that we were not getting service, but nothing happened. I did mention it again at checkout, as I was surprised/disappointed by the lack of response. A few days later, I received a very concerned email from the hotel manager, who offered to personally book our next visit, so.... my point is not to complain or extoll here, but just to let readers know what happened. I, personally, am satisfied, and would definitely go back. | Our room was an upgrade, and the bathroom was gorgeous, with an oversize, freestanding, Roman tile tub. The bed and furnishings were lovely and comfortable, and we had a nice view to the Eye. | I do love the location, and we were lucky, as we were there for 9 of the only sunny days I think the city has had this summer ! (It started to rain the day we left, the day before the Queen's Jubilee. ) The fine weather made walking so easy and pleasant. Went to the Chelsea Flower Show, which is definitely worth the visit. | One disappointment was Massimo's. In November, we ate there once, and it was excellent. This time, it really was mediocre, I'm afraid. I hope they step it up and make it good again, because the space the restaurant occupies is beautiful. | Room service breakfast was excellent and punctual. | Bar service at North Hall was excellent. | Wait service in the lobby, where I spent a lot of time, was really spotty. You had to really flag the staff down, except for one man, who seemed to be the manager. He was always on the ball. I was chatting with a pretty major celebrity one day, and he mentioned the same thing about having to flag them down, so at least they don't treat a celeb differently than any other! | The spa and workout area was wonderful, once again. So clean and perfect and professional. I had the excellent Sinead for a facial, and later, for a massage. | I highly recommend these restaurants: Ottolengthi's new Nopi; Veeraswamy (elegant, delicious Indian), Wild Honey (so good!!), Mele E Pere, &amp; The Wolseley (worth it just to experience the space). | All in all, I hope to visit again next fall or winter.","Boston, MA",7/17/2012

The Dorchester,2,Didn't live up to expectation,"Having stayed once before was looking forward to a three night stay in a junior suite, booked direct with hotel. | Helpful, courteous pick up at airport from an early morning flight. Was informed at check in that the room type we had booked was not yet ready, hardly surprising as it was still only 0800. We were offered a ""very nice superior room"" as being available immediately. having slept adequately in overnight first on TG and being keen to get out and explore we were happy to wait for the junior suite to become ready later in the day. I wasn't given any other information on the room we were being offered to know whether to accept it or not and was concerned not to end up paying for a basic room when i had booked a ""junior suite"". | What a mistake! The ""suite"" was adjacent to intrusive AC compressors, and was best described as low ceilinged council house 1980s chic overlooking more of the same - think Peabody trust without the altrusitic pricing structure. Lots of swaggy curtains, yet nowhere to unpack a suitcase and a Holiday Inn style bathroom with a marble tiled makeover. Except the shower screen din't fit and meant the bathroom floor was drenched whenever one showered. | Despite assurances that our luggage would be in the room when we returned at 2.30 pm, it wasn't. The receptionist who escorted us to the room assured me he would arrange for it immediately once the oversight was realised. I imagine he forgot. 20 minutes later I called the bell desk, the luggage arrived about 10 minutes later. | We decided to freshen up before dinner with a steam to sweat out 11 hours of flying. The spa / steam room was closed for renovation. I was starting to get a bit tetchy by this stage, but the concierge was helpful and arranged for us to use the steam room at the Park Lane Hilton. That, followed by a pint in Shepherds Market, made me realise that there were numerous alternative hotels that would work for us and offering better value too. On our return I informed the receptionist that we planned to check out early. She helpfully informed me that we had already been given a room upgrade and that there was nothing to be done. I'd hoped for service - not freebie upgrades. Shame. | We returned to the room just after 8pm. It hadn't been made up. | I called the Duty Manager, more to vent frustration at the P--- poor service and VFM that the Dorchester was peddling. To his credit he seemed concerned and to want to make a difference. He asked what he could do to make amends. Having irretrievably lost faith in the Dorchester's ability to deliver service or value it might have helped more if he could have suggested something himself. In my jetlagged state I could only suggest he made sure our revised check out date was noted by reception so that I could move to a hotel that ""did what it says on the tin"". | A bill of around 800 pounds for an overnight stay was presented in the morning. We moved to the Park Lane Sheraton, which promises rather less but delivered substantially more - at half the price. | The positives? Breakfast is pretty good. Should be at 35 pounds or so, but I don't begrudge paying for quality. | Sadly, the rest of our Dorchester ""experience"" fell shamefully short.","Istanbul, Turkey",3/16/2009
The Lanesborough,5,An afternoon in High Society,"My wife and I stopped by on a cool, cloudy Spring afternoon to relax and warm up. She stayed at the Lanesborough a couple of years ago just before the hotel was remodeled and wanted to show me the changes. We were treated like royalty in the Library Bar where Benoit served us perfectly! We enjoyed a couple of cocktails and some snacks while perusing a book Benoit loaned us detailing all the remarkable renovations performed on this magnificent Hotel. Even though we didn't spend the night this time, it's on our list for a future visit.","Seattle, Washington",3/29/2016
The Dorchester,5,End of succesful business year and end of year meeting,"My colleague &amp; I had a meeting to set limits for quarter one 2016 so he was bringing his partner so I did same to let them xmas shop whilst we had meeting. Booked The Dorchester as a luxury treat. Really not disappointed, fabulous experience, everyone very polite and service exceptional, room was superb. Yes, top end hotel but very worthwhile albeit your credit card suffers but you really enjoy. The first evening I met up with my daughter at Le Caprice but second night had dinner with my colleague and partners at the Dorchesters in house 3 star Michelin resturtant. OMG 4 x taster menus, it was sublime, table booked 6.30 and when we arrived it did not seem busy but that had changed by 7.30 so really pleased we sampled this feast of extravagence. ""The starter of pink champagne"" set the tone for the girls for the evening adding extra luxurious costs but certainly an evening a stay to remember.","Norwich, United Kingdom",1/30/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Best Hotel in London! Your Expectations will be Exceeded at Every Turn!,"This property will blow you away! It's beautiful, well appointed, and the staff is top notch. From the hundreds of vases of fresh cut flowers everyday in the lobby and in the room to the modern and well appointed gym, you can't beat this hotel in London. It's the small details they get right-like reaching out to us via e-mail to see if there was anything we needed before we checked in, the healthy treats in the fridge at the gym, the bowl of fresh fruit in the room, the seamless interior decorating of the room, built-in US/Euro outlets, and the amazing turn down service.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Another great stay at the Mondrian London! No doubt ill be down there again soon!,"I'm always happy to stay at the Mondrian London, the location is great, the service is excellent and the bars and restaurant are class! | Unfortunately on this occasion the Rumpus Rooms was closed for a private function but the bar on the ground floor was open and it has a really nice atmosphere. On check in I was provided a free complimentary upgrade as I was a returning customer which was a great touch. | Overall a great place to stay in a couple or a group of friend heading out on the sauce !",Sheffield,1/3/2018
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Best hotel experience ever!,"My boyfriend and I had an incredible stay here!

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,My husbands birthday,I stayed here with my husband for his birthday - it is a very busy hotel and has a good vibe! | The rooms are well equipped and nicely designed and great for an overnight stay! I dont find you get treated like a resident though.... the Bar man in the restaurant was rude when we wanted to get a drink and I didnt find the drinks very well presented for a hotel of this type! Big thick glasses for gin and vodka and no garnish!! | Also we went up to the rumpus room and just got a table for 45 mind - again no preferential treatment for stayed in the hotel!,"Hitchin, United Kingdom",11/18/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Amazing!,"The hotel was beautifully decorated, very clean, great location and just all around amazing but what made this hotel special was the service. | The front desk staff and concierge service were both extremely helpful. The front staff desk went out of their way to resolve a family issue (i.e. concerned parents calling to check on us) which was very comforting. The concierge service was also very helpful in finding and reserving local restaurants. They were great. | The hotel is one of the nicest hotels I stayed in. Just a real clean, modern, trendy looking design that also has a lot of character to it. I would highly recommend the hotel bar (which isn't your typical hotel bar), where we got some of the best drinks in London. The atmosphere and design was fantastic. The hotel restaurant we ate at was also very good too (if you need a quick bite to eat). | The rooms were very nice, clean and the bed was very comfy. It was a perfect room for travelers looking to rest after a long day of exploring. | What was best about this hotel was the location. It is right in the center of everything you need to do in London. All the big tourist attractions are all within a mile or so and walking distance. What was even better was the train stop, for both local traffic and airport traffic, was RIGHT next to the hotel (10 minute walk with luggage). If you're looking to get around London, the tube is a great way to do that. The tube stop is a 10 minute walk too. | Overall just a great, great experience. Would highly recommend.","Columbus, Ohio",12/17/2015
The Savoy,5,Realising a dream,"As a child my wife passed the hotel every weekend on way to hospital wishing she was going to the savoy instead. 40 years later she was able to stop and go in to make the dream a reality. Sometimes when you want something so much it fails to live up to expectations. Well I'm glad to say this well and truly surpassed all expectations. | We stayed on a dinner bed and breakfast deal. From our arrival to departure everything was perfect. The welcome and assistance from staff was first rate. Despite working hard and sometimes for demanding people their politeness and cheerfulness was a credit to the company. | The room was excellent and extremely well appointed. The bed as comfortable as can be. The shower was like sitting under a hot Victoria falls. Dinner at Kaspars was extra special being seated by the window, a birthday treat in itself. The food was sublime. | Thanks to the bed we nearly missed breakfast, which was way too much but I gave it a good go. | A lot of what I say people may think it should be as a matter of course but you feel the people really do go the extra mile for you. | I'm shocked when I see some poor reviews. I cannot comment on other people's experiences but do wonder about the legitimacy and motivation when I have experienced such excellent treatment. As a disabled guest I'd like to state their treatment of my wife was faultless. I have seen a report slating their lack of disability awareness. This could not be further from the truth. I can only imagine it was not obvious that someone could not do the stairs to Kaspars and they certainly could not have told the staff because they are only too willing to show you to the restaurant, on a route bypassing the steps. | Considering the history the stories the guests that have stayed, I consider it a privilege to have spent a night at London's top hotel",london,2/16/2014
The Dorchester,5,Valentine's day stay,"arrived at the Dorchester hotel around 1pm. check-in was smooth, polite and let us have our room early. | the room was done out in a classic luxuary style... | we enjoyed drinks at the bar in the evening and the waiter was very friendly. | breakfast in the morning was beautiful at the grill. | only minor thing was that I found the room heating and water temperature a little erratic. | all in all very lovely stay.","London, United Kingdom",2/15/2018
The Rembrandt,4,Very nice AFTER we changed rooms,"When we first arrived we were given a very small, fusty room, into which there wasn't even enough room for our suitcases. When we complained (we were booked for an executive room), we were informed that we shouldn't have booked through Expedia and that the room couldn't be changed. We were quite insistent and finally moved into room 450, which was roomier although quite dated. However, the room turned out to be comfortable, and we thought the breakfast was more than adequate. As others have mentioned, the location is superb. My special local treat was the cappuccino and macaroons at Paul near the tube station.",nyc,12/25/2012
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,1 Night Romantic Stay,"This hotel exceeded expectations, we upgraded to the the Executive room, which was not much more and well worth it. We had a lovely room, very clean and a great little balcony (room 105). It was very quiet, close to Earls Court tube. The staff were so friendly and the concierge was really helpful. A great hotel for a nice night away and I think very reasonably priced !","Brighton, United Kingdom",10/30/2014
The Savoy,5,Personal Service Perfection,"On our way to Oxford for the week, my daughter and I made a day/night stop in London. She was attending a conference and I tagged along; London was a mere stopover for dinner and a play and The Savoy is my new favorite place! My daughters birthday was our lone day and the hotel made it aware so at tea, dinner (The Savoy Grill) everyone made a point to tell her happy birthday. From the moment we arrived until we left the staff were first rate. Tea was wonderful but the breakfast is the best and would strongly recommend if staying to include this in your stay. Very few hotels have excellent coffee and when you have just come off an international flight, good coffee is a must. The only disappointment was the Grill. It was very good; not excellent.","Alexandria, Louisiana",3/15/2018
A To Z Hotel,2,Interesting,Very friendly. Bedding was clean. Situated in good location. Hard to park car if it was busy. | Breakfast was cup of tea or coffee and toast...don't expect full English if going to book.. | Room was not ready.,"Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom",8/30/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,5,excellent hotel,"I absolutely loved this hotel. The attention to detail is meticulous and deeply satisfying.

The Dorchester,5,Second home,"Literally when I go back to the Dorchester i feel like going to my second home! | The hospitality the type of rooms and the service I get I feel like Im in my second home ! | Except to my last visit I was a bit surprise ! With the quality of service I started getting, I was surprised that twice during my 2 weeks stay the room service forget to clean my room while I was out for 8hours! | And I had to raise the issue until they started taking care of my room. Bare in mind Im a regular customer who stays in the hotel twice yearly. | More so an incident happened with the Concierge as I was trying to book at fire chilter place and he was claiming that their phone is not working! While I was standing in front of him I managed to call and made the reservation on the spot I was a bit surprised with the level of service I used to get and the last visit.!",NA,12/23/2017
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",3,Hmmm...,"I stayed here on a business trip. First impressions were not great as the doorman was nowhere in sight when my cab arrived so i lugged my bag in myself. While some people might like the fact that the reception person comes with you to your room to get the forms signed etc (I presume this is usual?) i didn't. A nice touch though was that a complimentary tray of coffee and biscuits was sent to the room after my arrival (which had been early morning following an overnight flight). | I found the room somewhat stuffy - i usually like a classical theme but it somehow didn't work for me. I had no view of anything except concrete, and I didn't like the fact that I didn't have a separate shower. There was also a lot of noise from the passage. On the other hand, the amenities were good, i liked the complimentary bottles of water and apple juice, toiletry/vanity stuff of expected quality etc. | All in all I had a pleasant enough stay here, but felt it didn't quite live up to what I would have expected - the Mandarin in NYC was much nicer I thought.",SA,10/27/2007
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,"Awesome location, super cool property","I definitely recommend a stay at the new Mondrian in London. It's very well located in the city. It's proximity to the path along the river makes it easy to get just about anywhere in central London. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgable. The lobby has a relaxed, cool vibe - perfect for relaxing, having a drink and watching people walk by along the riverfront. The rooms are big and comfortable and come with quality amenities.","Culver City, California",1/19/2015
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,A Real Pleasure................................,"We booked this hotel through The Daily Telegraph 'hand picked' travel section, so a very good price for a London hotel but it far exceeded our expectations. The staff are exceptional - immaculately turned out, friendly, professional and so helpful, nothing was too much trouble - is this thanks to 'in house' training? if so, well done! - you should start a training scheme for other hotels. A special mention for Daniel who was an absolute star - a young man who surely must go far in the hospitality business. | This hotel is about 5 minutes walk from Moorgate station, in the business area, so very quiet at weekends, which is great for a peaceful nights sleep but if its night life you want then you will have to travel a little - it suited us fine. | The rooms are superb - very comfortable, beautifully designed and furnished, modern with co-ordinated bed linens and curtains - all top quality. There is also a lovely flat screen TV mounted on the wall and a Bose I-pod stand. A well stocked mini-bar but prices rather steep - £17.50 for a half bottle of fairly ordinary wine, £3.50 for a small can of tonic etc - I'm sure more people would avail themselves of hotel mini- bars if the prices were a little more realistic - but not a major gripe. There is also a very simple to operate safe in the built in wardrobes. The room had AC but operated very quietly. | The good sized, very modern bathroom is a delight, with a separate bath and walk-in shower, fluffy towels and a lovely selection of Elemis toiletries, plus of course the Apex duck. Dressing gowns were also provided but we did not use them. | Our room on the 4th floor overlooked the road where a building opposite is being renovated but due for completion fairly soon but any work certainly did not disturb us. | The public rooms and restaurant are lovely - one of the nicest restaurants we have been to in any London hotel. The tables in the restaurant are set into 'mini -rooms' so give a much more intimate feel to the dining experience and each large window facing the street has a bowl of beautiful white orchids - indeed each table has a very simple but stunning contemporary flower | arrangement as do all the tables in the bar, which presumably are changed on a regular basis as they looked so fresh - a lovely touch which just added to the whole look of the rooms. We also liked the lighting - enough for you to see exactly what you are doing but subdued enough to create a good ambiance. | The food itself is excellent. There is a superb choice at breakfast catering for all tastes which is served at your table - no buffet breakfast here where food has sat for ages and been picked over- my fruit platter was beautifully served as was the 'full English'. Only complaint? the tea is a bit weak - for the size of pot it really does need at least two tea bags!! | We also ate in the Restaurant for 2 of our evening meals and the experience was just as good - not the widest choice in the world but again beautifully served. Service was very good, staff attentive without being intrusive and we felt the menu offered good value for money. After a day trudging round London it was good to come back to the hotel, shower and know that all we had to do to eat was go downstairs. | All in all a wonderful experience in a most comfortable hotel, within easy reach of the underground and main line stations. Most certainly we would recommend it to others and most certainly, if we see it at the right price, it would be our hotel of choice for visiting London, so many, many thanks to all those who work so hard, front of house, house-keeping etc to make it such a lovely hotel - it was a real pleasure to stay there.",Lancashire,9/5/2012
The Savoy,5,Where life-long memories are made,"For me, the London Savoy is the best hotel in the world. Not only is it in the absolute heart of the worlds most fabulous city, but everywhere you would want to go is just a pleasant walk away. | The hotel leaves absolutely no detail left to chance. The stunning Art Deco features extend from the rooms down to the cutlery and glassware, complemented by Edwardian counterparts depending on the room you're in. Everything here is substantial and genuine; no imitations in sight. | Perfect food and drink, service, comfort, cleanliness and overflowing with proper style. | Our second stay here ends today, and we are truly sad to be leaving, but looking forward to our next visit with anticipation of more of the very best. | The only thing that disappoints us at times is some of the other guests. Respect this iconic establishment if you choose to stay here. Dress and behave appropriately, or stay elsewhere!",Ipswich,5/25/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Return visit - didn't disappoint,"Returned to the Corinthia for the second time last weekend and had another great stay. The hotel is special in every way. We were looked after extremely well and the staff were, once again, excellent.",cambridge,4/22/2013
The Dorchester,4,Christmas meal in the Orchid Room/Holford Room,"The Good Bits | Been quite a few times for our company's Christmas get-together. | A Beautiful place outside , reception, Christmas tree's etc is stunning. Staff are really good , helpful and well turned out. | Great atmosphere. | Their were 70 of us attending for a 4 course Christmas meal. | Tables were set beautifully. Wine service excellent - Particularly in the Holford room before hand. | The best part of the meal were the deserts, (I had two). works of art. | The not so good points | Only one roll offered throughout the meal. Main meal of Beef, were very small although tasty. Not enough extra veg offered no gravy. A Huge gap between courses, nearly an hour. Coffee was revolting cold . | Considering this was around £115 per head - not quite so 5 star.",Watford,12/12/2017
The Dorchester,5,Fabulous!!!,"We went on a date night last weekend and from the start of our visit we're wowed by the standard of service and attention to detail from all the members of staff who we met. They couldn't do enough for you. | The hotel is beautifully designed and decorated with fresh flower displays. The staff were extremely knowledgeable and attentive whilst discreet - a fine balance. | Our meal was beautifully presented, well crafted and was absolutely delicious. | We loved our spending time here and definitely hope to be back! | Would highly recommend!","London, United Kingdom",6/26/2017
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Pure luxury,"Fantastic hotel to stay in. Courteous staff, lovely room with lots of space. Room service meal was also great quality. Stayed with small child that could've gone badly wrong but it all worked very well as was for one night only . Doorman helped with the buggy and reception staff all pleasant. Expensive but the hotel is in the upper bracket of luxury.","Aberdeen, United Kingdom",12/17/2012
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Lovely hotel,"Stayed just one night but would highly recommend. Rooms, as always in London, are small but very comfortable. Staff were great, really helpful. Cocktail bar was lovely, nice choice of drinks, good service and a lovely place to relax at the end of our very busy day! Amazing location, several tubes in easy walking distance as is natural history museum, royal Albert etc. Would highly recommend and would happily return.","Birmingham, United Kingdom",12/18/2014
Corinthia Hotel London,4,Nearly great,"I've stayed here a few times now. Overall experience Is wonderful. But I'll focus on the few downsides. Mobile phone reception is dire. Fixing this would up my score to the highest level. Gripe 2 is breakfast. Slow. I've stopped bothering (so they might have fixed it by now). A few times I've ordered and waited and experienced painfully slow delivery and sloppy attention to detail. Tea without milk, toast without butter. And gripe 3, a few weeks ago, an event which shut the bar and when I walked on intomNorthhall with my guest and asked if we could get a drink their first question was ""are you a resident"". I was but resented the question, and impression it left with my guest. We were shunted into the lobby where we were looked after well but the transition was annoying. I love the rooms though and the staff are mainly fantastic. I'd like to think these are teething pains. Back on Monday so will see....",Nottingham,12/2/2011
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,2,OVERATED,"Expensive for not much!! borderline rude staff (at times) Do not be fooled by pics of this hotel, the rooms are tiny! (and i booked a superior room) Shoe box springs to mind. I had a patio (paid extra for) total waste of time, i thought we could look over Thames but we got to overlook a building under construction. Beds altho comfortable, they are tiny. Heating worked well but it was noisy and only way to stop that was to put it off entirely. Bathroom tiny. Wardrobe is a joke, its basically a hole in the wall with a curtain! No there are far more worthy hotels in London. I'm actually quite angry i paid so much for this mediocre hotel","Glasgow, United Kingdom",11/27/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Fantastic hotel and spa,"Husband and I spent one night here to celebrate our anniversary. Perfectly located on the southbank, The rooms and staff were fabulous. Modern but homely and everything need was taken care of. The Agua spa was incredible and the staff were so helpful, friendly and accommodating. I had a fabulous treatment with Tea and will definitely be back to the hotel and spa for more indulgent luxury!",NA,4/15/2015
London Guest House,4,All is well at London Guest House,"This review is long overdue, but I thought I should share anyway. We stayed at London Guest House in May 2011. I had read the good reviews on Tripadvisor and we decided to book. | We are a family of 4 with 2 children who were 2,5 and 10 months old at then time of travel. | We arrived very late in London and when we stepped off the Tube at North Acton at 11 pm, I discovered I had forgotten the directions to the hotel. Had the phone number though, so I called the hotel and a very helpful voice answered and helped us get there. | The hotel is situated in Acton, a brisk 15 minute walk or 5 minutes by bus from the Tube in North Acton. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel. We find walking in London very enjoyable, so most mornings we walked. | I can´t say anything else about the hotel other than that we were very pleased with our entire stay there. We got a room on the ground floor, with a large queen sized bed and a cot for our youngest son. The room was situated at the front of the hotel, so we got the sounds from Horn Lane, but there was no trouble sleeping at all for any of us. Not a lot of traffic in the small hours of the night. The room was well decorated and very clean. Bathroom was very small, but there was no problem doing your business of showering etc in there. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towels provided whenever we wished. | Breakfast was included in the price and we enjoyed that very much too. How often do you get the chance to have crisps (which my wife and kids loved) and muffins (which I loved) without feeling guilty? A holiday is a holiday. Other than that, there was toast, coffee, juices, tea, jam and fruit. All served in a small, but nice and bright breakfast room. | We met 3 or 4 of the staff during our 5 night stay and they were most helpful each and everyone of them. I know that people complain about hotel staff being rude in London, so if nice and helpful staff is important to you, London Guest House is a no- brainer. | If you don´t mind staying a few tube stops away from the very center of London (5 or 6 stops and 15 minutes from Queensway), I can warmly recommend London Guest House.",Sweden,3/16/2012
The Rembrandt,3,A Problem,"This is my second stay at The Rembrandt, my first review rated the hotel excellent, this review not so good. I requested a room facing the street and Victoria and Albert Museum, I requested the room 6 months in advance. Upon check in the clerk informed me that they did not have a room for me thatI requested. I had prepaid for my room. I was asked to change rooms after one day. I really didn't want to unpack and pack ,again. I asked the desk clerk why the other guests were not told to move for me and she looked like I had 2 heads,she became rude. Since I had pre pay and there is refund,what was I to do. But as soon asI got to room 332,I became very mad. It had to be the smallest room in the hotel with a view of heating/cooling pipes. Then figured it out, I pre paid with no refund,they could putin any crummy room they want. I have again pre paid for 2 rooms in November, I just wonder how bad those will be, but since I cannot cancel I will have to stay. I do not recommend this hotel because oft their shady practices.","Phoenix, AZ",8/31/2014
Rhodes Hotel,3,I want to agree...,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Rhodes hotel in September 2006. It came highly recommended by a colleague and the reviews on trip adviser were fantastic. The hotel is around a 5 minute walk from Paddington Station. We caught the Heathrow Express to Paddington so we found the location very handy. We paid 75 pounds a night for our room, which included taxes and breakfast. Chris was lovely and made us very tasty scrambled eggs for breakfast each morning. The room was a decent size for London, however the bathroom and shower were TINY. I understand that hotel rooms in London are very small, so I guess this is to be expected. The interior of the hotel is a little run down and in need of an update. However the outside is lovely. The Rhodes Hotel is within walking distance of Hyde Park and there is a bus stop right outside Paddington Station that will take you to the main attractions. However, I don't think I would stay at this hotel in the future. Call me fussy =)",Melbourne,10/10/2006
Rhodes Hotel,5,"Nice, small, comfortable, homelike","It's only 10 mins walking distance from Paddington station. Compact and clean. The only disadvantage is stairs only, without lift. Carrying heavy luggage is not an easy task. Breakfast is served in a small space which I enjoyed the atmosphere very much. It's more homelike rather than hotellike. We felt great and relaxed here.","Taipei, Taiwan",10/28/2017
Rhodes Hotel,4,Jeder Zeit ein Aufenthalt wert.,"Die zentrale Lage zwische dem Bahnhof &amp; der Metrostation Paddington und der Metrostation Lancaster Gate, sowie die direkte Parknähe zum Hyde Park ist ein wirklich optimaler Ausgangspunkt zur Erkundung der Stadt. Das Zimmer war gut ausgestattet und stets sauber. Die Mitarbeiter waren sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.","Düsseldorf, Deutschland",6/12/2016
Newham Hotel,2,OK As A Young Foreign Visitors Base,"My partner and I booked this through www.booking.com as a convenient overnight stay and got a twin bedded room with kettle, tea and coffee for £50.00, which in the London area is cheap. So....... we didn't expect much and we didn't get much except for the all inclusive English cooked breakfast which was very good. The place was dirty, damp and the public/communal toilets let us knew they were there! The bedding was fresh and clean. The en suite bathroom was not good, but just about worked. The staff were excellent and very friendly. Location - if you want to get into London City Centre and do all the tourist stuff then this is a good base. The buses run from outside the door into the City Centre but 5 mins down the road on the same bus is the London Underground and national railway to get you anywhere in the UK. There is also a great shopping centre in Stratford where the buses stop. Overall I'd class this hotel as a downmarket bed and breakfast place but if you are on a budget, use it.","Birmingham, United Kingdom",4/7/2015
The Savoy,5,True Quality and Perfection,"Stay at The Savoy you wont be disappointed! We spent my husbands 60th birthday there and it was fantastic.The hotel is immaculate, staff friendly but professional and the service excellent. Thank you Savoy for making our trip so memorable - we'll be back. Mrs Jager, Sussex.",Pulborough,7/22/2014
The Savoy,5,Excellent,Writing this on our last day. The hotel is very impressive through out. Drinks are pricey but you expect that on this standard of hotel. All the restaurants are excellent.The standard rooms have been done to a very high standard. No free wifi in the hot.,NA,7/26/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,This is what you need!,"This was my first trip to London and this hotel was our choice for the stay. What to say... Very very nice place! The staff is always smiling, kind and attentive to us. | We loved the location, the view from our room, the room itself (very clean and cosy, big bathroom and shower), the rooftop bar... well everything. | The design is very classy and modern. | I would definitely come back to mondrian for my next London trip.",Switzerland,1/26/2018
The Lanesborough,5,Like staying at Buckingham Palace,"My son and I could not have had a better stay at the gorgeously renovated Lanesborough. Absolutely stunning, 5 star luxury in every way. Amazing service and fabulous breakfast. Top concierge service- they got us in to all of the top restaurants during Easter week on short notice. Great location as well. Did not really love the private butler thing but if having someone unpack and press your clothes is your thing, then you will be in heaven. Can't wait to return!",New York,4/2/2016
The Savoy,5,Birthday celebration for a landmark age,My wife arranged a surprise birthday celebration staying in a suite with butler Service and river view | Obviously it was very expensive but once in a lifetime what the hell. | The room and views were stunning as evidenced in photos. | Our butlers Valentine and Francesco attending to our every need. | From high tea on arrival in our room with the table set up to enjoy the views through to breakfast the following day was a wonderful experience | The room ambience was extremely elegant and provided an excellent backdrop for our visit. | We had dinner on the Saturday night in the Savoy Grill owned by Gordon Ramsay and not the Savoy Hotel . | The food/wine was excellent but the atmosphere terrible due to too many covers for the size of the restaurant. | A rude awakening after the elegant surroundings of the hotel. | In fairness the hotel host on booking recommended Simpsons next door which has recently been refurbished and owned by the hotel and receiving excellent reviews. | We wont make that mistake next time. | Lunch the next day was in the hotels Kaspars restaurant which did not disappoint . | Excellent ambience/food/drinks and first class service with river views. | With valet Parking £55 overnight in central London was easy and the booking in process painless. | Youre whisked away to your room on arrival via the Ascending red room (nothing as common as a lift) to enjoy the delights of this first class hotel. | We will definitely stay again and enjoy being pampered in Royal style. | To enjoy this level of hospitality aint cheap but worth every penny particularly for those once in a lifetime experiences. | Well done to Fairmont and all its staff for making our visit truly memorable and very enjoyable,"Esher, United Kingdom",10/28/2017
The Dorchester,5,Lovely stay.,"We have traveled to London several times, and this was our first stay at the Dorchester. After years of dining at China Tang, having tea in the Promenade, and drinks in the Dorchester Bar, we were eager to stay here. | We weren't disappointed. The check-in/check-out staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. The room was beyond spacious - which surprised us, being as London's hotel rooms aren't always large. The bathroom was gorgeous. | I also enjoyed the closets - they had built-in drawers, motion-sensor lights, and lots of shoe storage. | We love to partake in room service, and this was really where the Dorchester shined. The china they use is precious, and every detail was considered. We tried the Japanese breakfast as well one morning, and it was delicious. | My personal favorite has always been tea in the Promenade, and continues to be. The ambiance is beautiful, serene and classy. I will always have tea service here any time I am in London. | We also enjoy the Bar - the manager always remembers us, and the drinks are divine. | We dined at Alain Ducasse this time. It was very good - although the staff had somehow gotten confused that I had a dairy allergy, which I don't. After correcting them several times, they continued to bring me separate dishes that were dairy-free. I wouldn't consider this a problem necessarily, but some people might find that a turn-off. | I don't think you can really go wrong with staying at the Dorchester. Which is why I am rating them 5 stars. | However, we were celebrating a birthday, as well as our engagement, and it would have been nice to receive extra recognition for this. (Alain Ducasse gave us a dessert). Perhaps a bottle of champagne in the room...? Or even the staff wishing us well would have gone a long way. | But again, our stay was lovely, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.","Houston, TX",10/29/2015
The Savoy,5,Superb venue- shame about the kippers!,"We had a marvellous two day stay including a birthday celebration. | The first morning we had breakfast in Simpsons- which is really old fashioned- but excellent food, and I had kippers. They were so good, that when we had breakfast the following day in the Savoy, my wife had the kippers- she was really disappointed to find they were boil in the bag kippers rather than fresh- how strange! | Staff were excellent- and indeed this was the only down side to a superb stay.","Glasgow, United Kingdom",9/15/2015
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Best Hotel I have stayed at in the U.K.,"As a special treat for my wife's 60th birthday, I planned a visit to London for the weekend. I found the Apex through Late Rooms, and the reviews were brilliant, so I booked it. | I have stayed in numerous hotels in the U.K both for leisure and business, and this hotel surpassed them all. The service was fantastic, room clean, comfortable, in fact superb. Meal in the restaurant was amazing. | This hotel had everything to make my wife's 60th birthday one to be remembered.",Preston,3/23/2011
Corinthia Hotel London,4,perfektes frühstück in der northhall,"ich war kein hotelgast, sondern habe an einem verregneten samstag morgen fürhstück eingenommen. unbedingt reservieren. eine große halle, marmor, edel, großzügig, viel platz zwischen den tischen, so dass man privatsspähre hat. gute rservice, große auswahl an gerichten. preis/leistung ok. publikum international und ca, ende 3o/anfang 40. | eine angenehme erfahrung und ein toller start in den tag. | insgesamt ein bischen wie die grand hotels der 20ziger jahre.",Hamburg,4/1/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,A Real Gem,"Our room was a standard double. Modern in style, immaculate, everything you need for a luxury stay. The bed was billed as a queen, not too sure. Maybe a 'London' queen, but very comfortable. There are little touches such as the crystal glassware and the ornamental fortune cookie with a different daily affirmation which make it stand out from the usual London abode. | The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. The reception staff were happy to print a document for me as no guest computing facilities were available. | We used the downstairs bar one evening and the atmosphere was great. Good music, quick and friendly table service, I'd highly recommend as a place to enjoy great views and the atmosphere of the south bank. | Our one huge disappointment was that the top floor Rumpus Room bar was closed on the two nights we visited, Sunday and Monday. Apparently this is advertised on the website but I didn't see that information. I wish we'd been informed when we received confirmation of the booking. This facility was a major factor in our choice of location. Had we known we wouldn't necessarily have cancelled but it would have managed our expectations. For this bar to be closed on Mother's Day was a real surprise. For any guest to miss out on that view is a shame and one night closed I might understand but two a week is confusing. | Still worth a visit.","York, United Kingdom",3/9/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Amazing 30th birthday treat I will never forget. SPECTACULAR,"My wife surprised me with a nights stay at the Mondrian and it was amazing. We turned up to a really friendly welcome from a valet called Hamish who couldn't have made us feel more welcome. We then checked in and were shown to our suite which was stunning. Everything you could want from a room and more and generously proportioned. We then, following planning from my wife enjoyed drinks in the stunning, exclusive rooftop bar, a lovely dinner in the sea containers restaurant and further cocktails in the dandelion bar where we indulged the 'mixologist' within us. We then returned to our room to enjoy the bottle of champers we had sent to our room. I can't wait to return the favour and take my wife back. Spectacular!",NA,12/7/2014
The Savoy,5,Historically!,"One of the best experience in London. Specially employees, always smiley faces and trying to do their best for you. Yes price is high, but it worth specially if you need a good sleep and comfortable bed!","Istanbul, Turkey",4/14/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,"Mondrian London, sunsets and cocktails","Picture the perfect day in London. Sun has been shining all day, it is the perfect, warm mid summer's evening, you are in the mood for a lovely cocktail at dusk. I could not think of a better setting that the Mondrian Hotel on the Southbank. With the beautiful views of the Rumpus bar, impeccable service, scrumptious food and wine list with the best wines to accompany your meal at the Sea Containers restaurant. It has become my favourite hang-out place in London. I have celebrated my birthday here, and had bushiness meetings here too. And will soon have a reunion for my school friends next weekend. I know I will be really happy and my guests will be suitably impressed with my excellent choice in venue!","London, United Kingdom",8/19/2015
The Savoy,4,Fab renovations,"One night stay. We arrived in a rush to get to a meeting. We dropped of bags, and dashed off. Doormen lovely. Arriving back to the hotel, we were taken to our room. Having requested non smoking (I'm asthmatic) the room was a smoking room. Apologies were given, and we were taken to another room. This one the electrics didn't work. Again more apologies. We were then taken to the American bar whilst another room was found. This was full, so on to the other bar for a complimentary beer for hubby and a pot of tea for me whilst a room was located and our luggage moved. We were upgraded for the hassle to a 'suite' however this was more a larger room than a suite. For the price and status of hotel would have expected this quality room in the first place. But very nice. With a nice bathroom and fab toiletries. Another rush to get ready for dinner and theatre, due to waiting for the room. Afterwards we returned to the room refreshed. (I will never tire of turndown service) Both slept like a log. Great hotel, but didn't feel like had time to enjoy room as had to wait for it, then had to rush to get out for reservation. After a busy day, not good. However if these problems were ironed out would return, as beautiful. Also staff lovely.","Yarm, United Kingdom",4/26/2013
The Savoy,5,First Class,"The first time I've stayed here and my expectations could not have been higher. The Savoy over delivered. My partner and I were celebrating our anniversary, so for us, a special treat. | The check in procedure is simply fabulous, and is an indication to the level of service that one can expect throughout the entire hotel. In fact there is no check in service, a host meets you at the hotel entrance and you are given an orientation as to where everything in the hotel is and then shown to your room, where you are very discreetly asked for your credit card. Done. No waiting at check in, waiting for porters etc etc. Wonderful. | We were given an up grade to a deluxe room, which was very nice. Everything you would expect from one of the worlds best hotels, beautifully furnished, extremely comfortable beds and all the 'trimmings' you would expect. | What makes The Savoy so fantastic though is the service. Everyone we came into contact with was friendly, professional and very helpful. | The location is also perfect for everything we were in London for - Pollen Street Social restaurant and the theatre. | Our experience in the world famous American Bar was one we'll remember for the rest of our lives. Declan and his team here are simply brilliant and the cocktails were divine. | My only (slight) disappointment was that there was no buffet at breakfast, I was hoping to see a visual extravaganza but it was a la carte....very good it was too. | Thank you to everyone at The Savoy. Perfect.","Leeds, United Kingdom",7/10/2013
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Value for money,"If you stay in the City of London it will be a good place to stay in. The hotel is businesslike and warm, the staff is very friendful. It is a five-minute work from Moorgate metro station. There are a lot of restaurants and pub just around the corner. Gym is very moderate with a few training stuff. I was surprised that there is no sauna in the hotel. In the bar you can drink different sorts of local beer and strike up a conversation with a very friendful barman.","Moscow, Russia",11/28/2016
The Savoy,5,Simply the best,After a lot of saving we stayed here to celebrate my Partners 50th Birthday and it was worth every single Penny. | From the greeting by the doorman to our leaving after Breakfast the next day everything was perfect . Fantastic friendly super efficient staff delivering the very highest of standards . Not pretentious or aloof. Have never slept in a more comfortable bed . Afternoon tea was a wonderful experience as was the cocktail bar and breakfast . Thank you to you all for making our special occasion such a memorable one.,coventry,9/9/2017
The Savoy,5,The WoW Factor,"When you turn into the hotel entrance off the Strand, you step back into an era that only the rich and famous could afford. We were greeted by a concierge, who straight away made us feel has though we had been here many times, you now do not have to be famous, but being rich does help, we had a lovely suite £308 no breakfast though. They have a good choice of restaurants, we ate in Simpsons, we stayed one night has I had pre booked to stay in the Shard, we shall look forward to coming back for a longer stay.",stafford,6/19/2014

Newham Hotel,3,It is okay and safe and clean,"when booking I was worried if it is clean and what is the location.. | Location - by taxi from London City airport - about 20 min - just £14pounds | the staff is very friendly and will attempt to help you with your enquiries - SO ASK! | but check how they require your payment and when | The hotel is located not far from Green street ( where a lot of Asian food and shops are) | if you are looking for a European restorant /cafe - McDonalds is just 5 min away from teh hotel. We could not find any other cafes around to eat maybe we were just too tired. | Breakfast is served with the English breakfast and cereals - but as it is a low budget hotel the food is teh appropriate quality - the papermadeof sausage I could not eat. | For the second day our room was left untouched - no cleaning, changing towels,etc.. | to get to the central London - by bus N25 - just 1 pound per trip - it goes right to Oxford Circle - a bit long - over 1 hour - but thus you are doing a bit of a Sightseeing!","Isle of Man, United Kingdom",7/27/2009

The Savoy,5,Amazing British Luxury,"I booked a luxury room at the Savoy and they upgraded me to a river view king. | The lobby and tea parlor were full of elegance with an old fashioned charm. | The service was immaculate all throughout. It is also a big hotel but this fact does not affect the quality of service. | Overall, my favorite hotel in the world and the location is very convenient and central.","Miami, Florida",7/20/2015
The Savoy,4,Excellent restaurant,"I had dinner at the restaurant for my B-day with a few friends. Everything was outstanding... the food, the staff, the atmosphere (Live piano). I couldn't have picked a better place. The only thing I would say is that the lobster was very disappointing because it's so small considering the price I paid. I ordered the full lobster and it was equivalent to half a descent size lobster. Otherwise great!","London, England, United Kingdom",11/3/2013
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",4,Boutique hotel in Knightsbridge,"The hotel is located in Knightsbridge with good proximity to Mayfair, Bond Street, Harrods etc. The hotel is a good option for both business and leisure travellers. | As you enter the hotel you are likely to choke on the cigar smoke in the lobby. Whilst proclaiming to be a nonsmoking hotel the lobby always had smoke in the air which was explained as ""coming from the terrace"". | The rooms are nicely decorated and comfortable. My bathroom was large and the bath products are by Hermes. | This is a good hotel and a good choice if only choosing a hotel for sleeping or based on decor and comfort. If ambience and warm and friendly staff are important, then you may be disappointed. I found the front desk staff to be in a constant state of irritation. Mind you I was not asking for anything that was out of the ordinary or not in my booking. | However, the biggest negative for me was that there is no gym in the hotel, which nowadays is a standard in luxury hotel. I was shocked and disappointed as it never occurred to me that a hotel of this class would not have a gym. Working out is important for me. The hotel explained that they have a ""reciprocal agreement"" with a nearby gym. This nearby gym is a 20 minutes walk (across from the V&amp;A) and the reciprocal agreement is that you are charged £15 per day. This is so ridiculously expensive for the quality and of the facilities. It is essentially a spa with an afterthought of a gym. In fact when being shown around the facilities Spa services on offer (massage etc) were being explained. | This is not a hotel I will return to. In addition to the lack of a gym, just the hassle factor of getting the room I booked and being made to feel like it was an imposition on staff to do so makes it a never again!!","New York City, New York",9/7/2017
Rhodes Hotel,5,Viaggio a Londra,"Posto centrale vicino a due fermate della metro, ambiente pulito ed accogliente, personale gentile e disponibile, tra l' altro presente anche una persona dello staff Italiana che gentilmente ci ha dato preziosi consigli su i posti da visitare, mezzi da prendere ecc ecc. | Il titolare ed il personale greco molto attento e gentile. | Buona la colazione, ed anche se servita in una stanza relativamente piccola non ha creato attese lunghe ( masso 5 min. ) Nella nostra camera pavimento in legno ( e non moquette) bagno piccolo ma funzionale con regolare cambio degli asciugamani. | Complessivamente molto soddisfatti","Provincia di Brescia, Italia",3/2/2016

The Lanesborough,5,Best service anywhere,My son and I visited the restaurant for the first time. The service and attention we were shown was second to none. My son wasn't keen on the taste of one of the desserts so they went away and made him another one based on his favourite fruits. Such dedication to making him happy was testament to the level of genuine care we received. Best meal ever. Thank you Lanesborough staff.,"Lincolnshire, United Kingdom",7/21/2016
The Savoy,5,Exceeds Expectations,"This is our go to hotel each time we come to London for business or pleasure, and it does not disappoint. The staff is exceptionally trained, polite but not hovering or overwhelming. It is comforting after long travels to arrive at such a pleasant hotel with pleasant staff. This hotel is managed so well and the staff go above and beyond to accommodate its guests. The hotel itself is a lovely grand dame of a hotel. It embraces its deco-era heritage without being outdated or old fashioned. It feels fresh! The rooms are clean &amp; comfortable and serviced at least twice a day. We will keep coming back:) If you are in the mood for seafood, Scott's in Mayfair is Fab!!","New York City, New York",7/20/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Northall Restaurant,"My husband and I booked dinner at the Northall restaurant in June. It was the £35 3 course with cocktail deal. I assumed the Northall restaurant was the tables seated around the perimeter of the Northall bar. Imagine our surprise when we were led into a lovely room beyond, with leather chairs. Luckily we were suitably dressed. For £35 we knew we wouldn't get full access the menu, but there were still several choices for each course. It also came with an amuse bouche, so make that 4 courses! The food in each course was superb and we haven't witnessed such excellent service in a British restaurant in such a long time. We made sure we thanked everyone who served us. Whilst it's great to post on TA for others to see, I think it is even more important to give instant feedback to those who have made your evening go so well. We enjoyed ourselves so much, we have decided to splash out for a night's stay in the hotel for our birthdays and of course we will book a meal at the Northall restaurant again. And a few cocktails at The Bassoon bar I'm sure.",UK,7/23/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,What a lovely Old-Worldy hotel,"We stayed here over a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Very nice room (if lacking in closet space), fantastic location, great concierge service, a very sweet Dutch guest relations manager, nice restaurant and bar. All in all a great hotel, especially if you are looking for an Old-Worldy Grand' Hotel of Europe kind of experience.","London, United Kingdom",3/29/2014
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Special Birthday Celebrated in Style !,"We chose to stay at The Corinthia while in London to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday in October 2013. From the moment we alighted from the taxi at the hotel's main entrance , we were made to feel special. After being greeted warmly and shown around the hotel ,we were escorted to an upgraded room for our 2 night stay. We feel that the hotel is very worthy of its 5star status - spacious and stylish , friendly and attentive staff , excellent range and quality of amenities ,perfect location for walking to places of interest . Dinner, with friends, on the Saturday evening in the Northall restaurant was a most enjoyable and relaxing experience .The waiter and sommelier offered good support when we were making our menu choices. Drinking champagne while listening to live music in the Bassoon Bar ended the birthday evening beautifully. We will certainly stay at The Corinthia again in the future.","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",10/9/2013
Ridgemount Hotel,4,"Great location, great value, friendly service""","I've stayed at the Ridgemount once or twice a year for about three years now, and I'll keep going back. The location is great, the price is amazing for central London, and the staff are lovely. It's a very simple B&amp;B kind of affair, and the decor probably hasn't changed much since the 60's, but that's why I like it! The place is kept spotlessly clean, towels are changed daily, and the free hot drinks in the lounge are a nice extra. The wifi works fine too. | The breakfast may be a bit of a shock for those who prefer croissants and yogurt in the morning, but it's a classic British combination: Cereals, then home-cooked bacon and eggs with loads of fresh toast and marmelade, good tea or coffee and juice. Yum! | I always stay in a room at the back of the hotel, which is wonderfully quiet. | This is not a hotel to lounge around in all day, but as a base to explore London from it offers a friendly experience and good value for money.",NA,11/10/2010
Corinthia Hotel London,5,"Excellent, if you can afford it","This was my second visit to this hotel and it is truly one of the best. The rooms are spacious and very well equipped (Nespresso machines!). Large king-size beds, quiet rooms at courtyards. Gym is fantastic and so is breakfast, the breakfast room being an attraction in itself. The only drawback: incredibly expensive (around 500 pounds per night)","Achterveld, The Netherlands",12/13/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Excellent service in a lovely hotel,"Stayed Friday night. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out the service was first rate. We tried the bar on the ground and the twelfth floor as well as the restaurant for breakfast. The service in each case was outstanding. | The river view room was as expected from a top hotel as were the other facilities so,it was the service that makes this stand out.",west sussex,11/1/2015
The Savoy,5,Heavenly stay!,"My husband booked a superior room for a one night stay, with dinner in the Savoy Grill, for our anniversary treat. From the moment we arrived I felt like I had died and gone to heaven! The opulent surroundings and general air of calm (even though the area was very busy) gave a wonderful first impression and the professionalism and general friendliness of the staff made you feel welcome immediately. Check in was a pleasurable experience and we were escorted by the friendly receptionist to our room. The room was all that you would expect from a hotel of this calibre; luxurious, light and airy. We decided to spend some time in the Health and Fitness area and thoroughly enjoyed a refreshing swim in the pool followed by a lazy sauna and steam. Later we again experienced service that can only be described as second to none, when we enjoyed a delicious meal in the Savoy Grill. The staff were attentive and polite and when we told them it was our anniversary they brought out a cake and decorated plate which added the perfect touch. | Overall I cannot praise this establishment enough, it is everything that you would expect and more. The whole experience was made magical for us and the staff appear rightly proud of working in such a fine hotel. I cannot wait to visit again!",england,10/8/2012

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Fantastic Birthday stay,"Had a brilliant time at Mondrian London.

The Savoy,5,Truly The Hotel to Benchmark,"From Entry to Exit this is the hotel every other should benchmark. | The concierge always greet with a smile and attend to every guest. | The warm, friendly and traditional lobby is welcoming and an excellent meeting point. | The front of house staff are elegantly dressed, down to earth welcoming and perfectly trained to cater to every need. | The rooms are generously proportioned, adorned with furniture and decor of exquisite taste and style. | In room dining offer food prepared to a high standard and the restaurants truly are befitting of a 5* Hotel. | After experiencing in great detail a stay at this hotel at a young age it truly is the best benchmark for any hotel for a generation. | Thank You The Savoy","Manchester, United Kingdom",2/23/2017
The Savoy,4,Fantastic.,"The are a few Hotels that you must stay at when visiting London and this is certainly one of them. The moment you walk in the door you feel that this will be something special. The service, staff and general facilities are first rate. The rooms themselves are pokey - but then again this is London, where space is at a premium. So if you dont mind a tight sleeping quarters - this is the place to go.",Australia,6/8/2018
The Dorchester,3,Disappointed,"We have been visiting the Dorchester for more than twenty-five years and have always been very impressed by the level of service. This visit was a distinct disappointment. | We typically book a suite and this vist was no exception. We had booked our suite two months in advance and received an received an acknowledgement. When we arrived we were told that our suite was not ready and they had now idea when during the week we had booked, it would become available. We were offered an ""upgrade"" to their Audley penthouse but since we had already stayed in one of their other penthouses on a previous vist and were not happy with it, we declined the offer. Finally at 5 pm the guest relations manager who was helping us finally came up with a Dorchester suite. ( I have no idea what machinations he had to go through, but he was very helpful. He even comped us to dinner at the Grill Room.) I was upset that we did have a confirmed reservation, I had been in touch with the hotel earlier in the week about particular amenities, and still they could not provide room we reserved with a big fuss on our part. | Since this was a business trip, we were traveling with two i-phones, a laptop and an i-pad. I was told by the e-butler that in addition to the normal twenty+ pound internet charge I would have to pay separate chages for wi-fi for each device. He told me that I could probably argue with the management to avoid these additional charges. Interestingly enough, when I did try the wifi connection for my i-pad, it did not work. He then acknowledged that wi-fi connectivity was a problem in this part of the building, i.e. a corner suite. | Room service was extremely disappointing. Our first morning we ordered an omlet and oatmeal. Both were cold. The next morning my husband ordered muelsli it it was good but the portion was miniscule. We ordered proper brewed tea and pumpkin muffins and were served bag tea and some other kind of unwarmed muffins. We had wanted to have a tea with friends in their Promenade. We could not get reservations so I ordered room service for five. The offered two pots of tea for five people and inadequate sandwiches. We also seemed to have a ""splenda"" crises. Every time they served us tea or coffee, only three small sacks of splenda were offered. It felt like we were going through rationing in wartime London. | I did write a letter to the manager the day before we left telling him about our disappointmet. In addition, I filled out their form asking someone is guest relations to contact me with via e-mail or cell phone. I have not received any contact from the Dorchester.","Palo Alto, California",10/17/2010
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Great modern hotel in central London,"Stayed in the hotel for 5 nights in July/August 2015. | Started off on a negative note while hunting for the hotel with our luggage as it is quite a walk from the nearest metro station (~10min). That is probably the only negative thing about our stay. | As soon as we got to the hotel the staff were very friendly, we were allowed to check in early (11am) which rarely happens in the bigger hotels nowadays. | The staff were also very helpful with our miscellaneous requests including taxi bookings, photocopying, printing, etc. | The room was very comfortable, not too small, modern and very clean. You can also find different charging outlets in the room (including USB ports). | We were also pleased that the room was soundproof given that the hotel is located in a very busy area. | In terms of food, we didn't order room service, however we had the buffet breakfast twice. The variety was good as was the quality and it wasn't too pricey. | The gym facilities were also quite good and the spa seemed appealing although unfortunately we didn't get a chance to try it. | We had a minor issue with the toilet seat, however it was resolved even before we pointed it out. | The hotel is also very close to a number of restaurants and attractions which would definitely keep you busy and entertained. | All in all, we had a great stay and would definitely stay there again. We highly recommend it.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates",8/17/2015

Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Best secret weekend stay in London,"I've stayed here twice now (only of a weekend) and will be there again on the 4th &amp; 5th of May. It's in the heart of The City so is very quiet from Friday evening onwards but close to tube stops and its always easy to flag down a black cab. The quiet is a good thing considering how close you really are to the big noise should you seek it and can then retreat from it. | I've been in a Deluxe room both times and it has two large LCD screens and a seperate lounge area with coffee facilities, stocked fridge, ironing facilities, Bose iPod speakers, awesome bathrooms with separate tub and large walk in shower with rainshower and hand held wand. | Reasonably priced (for London), the staff are friendly and excellent, the food is good, internet connection is very strong and included (I got 10mbps down 10mbps up on my iPad, more than enough to stream iPlayer etc). | I'm a Brit who has lived in America for the last 7 years and become spoiled on customer service and food quality and portions and this hotel more than meets those inflated standards.","Houston, TX",4/27/2012
The Dorchester,5,Un hotel excelente,"Era la tercera vez que ibamos a Londres y siempre estuve interesado en alojarme en The Dorchester y debo decir que no me decepcionó en absoluto.Habitaciones clasicas y cómodas, excelentes cuartos de baño y personal muy atento. | Tuvimos un pequeño problema al llegar con el equipaje que tardaron en subirlo a la habitación y tuvimos que reclamarlo.Salimos a dar un paseo y al regresar nos habían enviado una bandeja de bombones para disculparse. | Buen restaurante el Grill y excelente el Alain Ducasse con un menú al mediodia con una excelentisima relación calidad-precio y un servicio atentisimo en los dos restaurantes. | Muy bonito el Promenade donde tambien puedes tomar el desayuno. | Una mención muy especial para dos personas.Joe el encargado del Theatre Desk atentisimo y encantador y Laura en reservas una compatriota española tambien atentisima. | Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo, era como dije antes la tercera vez que viajabamos a Londres y este viaje fue muy diferente sobre todo por el hotel.","La Coruna, Spain",6/22/2010
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Mesmerising,"I didn't expect much initially, as the name didn't quite match what I thought would be like Four Seasons et al; however I was most amazed by what Corinthia had to offer. Simple things are of the highest quality; the bedroom slippers, the ESPA toiletries, the shoe shine, the flowers in the room by the in-house florist totally floored us, they also kindly packed it for us; the concierge is most helpful giving tips on where to park in Knightsbridge. I didn't mind the valet parking as it makes more sense to pay £55 than to look for parking around the parking lots around the streets and one had to pay significantly more if moving in and out from the place, we unfortunately paid £39 more 4 hours parking near Westminster parking bay area, and then used the valet parking. | The breakfast menu could be better improved for children's menu; we didn't see many children, we had a 4 year old who got a soft toy in the room. Fruits were abundant. The ESPA spa and gym and swimming pool were great, just be aware of kids only swimming until 11.30am. | Otherwise, a superlative stay. Thank you to all, especially Gaby from Costa Rica at guest relations. You are a gem helping my wife and I and would not be forgotten for your kindness. | Service is exemplary with afternoon tea.",Belfast,3/6/2016
Rhodes Hotel,1,Extremely rude service when trying to cancel reservation,"We did not stay at this hotel but were treated VERY RUDELY when trying to cancel our reservation over one week prior to our scheduled arrival date. | About 10 days before our trip, we decided to cancel the London leg of our travel because of the chunnel fire which affected service on the Eurostar. Because of the tunnel closure and reduced train schedule, Eurostar had emailed us and asked for us to please cancel our trip unless it was deemed ""essential"" travel. Since we didn't want the hassle of delays and possibly missing other travel connections, we decided to cancel our 3-day London leg. | I emailed Chris Crias, the owner, on Thursday morning from my office and had not heard from him by Friday night (the day before we would leave for Paris). Naturally, I wanted to confirm that he had received my email and that our room was successfully cancelled before i headed out for vacation (where I will not be available by email!) | I phoned and he (Chris Crias) answered . I told him I had emailed him and wanted to confirm he received my cancellation. He was completely rude and said ""so what do you want?"" and I said (nicely) that i simply wanted confirmation he received my email cancellation. He did not ask my name but simply said angrily ""I am very busy - I do not have time for this"", so I said, ""well can you look at your emails and confirm that you HAVE received our notice?"". Then he raised his voice and began to LECTURE me about how busy he was and what do I want from him and all this [-]. | I simply couldn't believe it! How completely and utterly unprofessional. I have never been treated so rudely by anyone in a very very long time. | I would NEVER stay at a hotel where the owner treats people he doesn't even know (and who call with a SIMPLE, relevant question) so terribly rudely. What a JERK! | P.S. I STILL do not know if my cancellation was received properly and hope that I am not charged for this room and that I receive back my payment. Otherwise, he will be reported to the police.",Calgary,9/19/2008

It is rare that I stay this long at any hotel and never have a single negative experience. This was the first time.

When you consider it's equally extraordinary location and the attentive and professional staff, I can't imagine a better hotel in London. We cannot wait to get back to London because it is a great city with much to see and do, but we really can't wait to get back to the Corinthia.",Mississippi,8/21/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Great hotel,I had really no complaints about this hotel. The location was awesome with a short walk to most everything around the Big Ben area. Staff was great and the hotel was overall very nice. Definitely staying here next time I get to London.,"Melbourne Beach, Florida",11/21/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Romantic weekend away,"My partner proposed in the Mondrian last year and so, to celebrate and revisit one year on, we booked a room in Mondrian and for dinner in Sea Containers. | From the moment we arrived and were greeted by Jessica on the front desk I knew it was going to be as special (almost) as last year. She was so welcoming and friendly, explained all the lovely extras they had offered for our special occasion and wished us well for our stay. | We had a few drinks in the well designed cocktail bar, Dandelyan on the ground floor where William was our waiter. Whilst being very observant and refilling our water glasses whenever we needed, he also had an extensive knowledge of the cocktails on offer. We were helped in our choices when we had a few we couldn't pick from and when they finally arrived he explained the history behind each one with a real flair! A credit to the team. | Dinner at Sea Containers was not quite what we were expecting having not eaten here last year and not having perused the menu beforehand. It is a sharing concept where you choose a selection of dishes between you. The starters and small plates were lovely and we possibly should have just stuck to a few more of those however my other half did want to try some of the meat on offer. These are quite large portions and so, having chosen the pork we couldn't quite finish it. The waitress, Jess, did tell us it was best for 3 however there wasn't a meat really fitting for 2. We had two sides to balance the meat but feel it could have done with a sauce also at it was on the salty side. | The staff in Sea Containers however were incredible. The complimentary champagne, organised by Jess, was a truly lovely touch and my request to sit in a different part of the restaurant on arrival, was accommodated within moments. | Staying at the Mondrian is a wonderful experience. The setting is perfect and the staff really rise to the occasion providing the best hotel service I have ever experienced. | Oh, and the breakfast is to die for!",NA,10/25/2016
"Bulgari Hotel, London",5,The best,"Bulgari Hotel in London is one of my top 3 hotels in London City. | The rooms are very modern and good size, the service is good, the atmosphere of the hotel is also amazing, the bar after a day of work is a perfect place to have drinks and find your friends...","Lisbon, Portugal",1/6/2018
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Nice hotel,Very modern funky hotel rooms are on the small side unless you | upgrade to a suite.If your hoping to make calls from your room | think again there is no signal what so ever so just rely on the free wifi.The hotel has a lovely spa very relaxing but unless u have a treatment booked there is only a sauna no pool or jacuzzi. | Breakfast was nice plenty of variety also other bars to drink and | eat definitely book a table at the rooftop bar (Rumpus Room) in | the evening good vibe lovely views over the Thames. | Well located close to Westminster easy to get to Mayfair &amp; Knightsbridge would stay there again.,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",2/14/2016
The Dorchester,5,"Superb hotel, incredible service..","My wife and I stayed at the Dorchester for just one night earlier this week as I had a business meeting to attend during the day and in the evening we had a theatre visit planned. | It was our first stay at the Dorchester and in fact although we are fairly regular visitors to the capital, we had never set foot inside this hotel before. | On other recent visits to London we have stayed at the Lanesborough, Landmark and the Savoy, lunched at Claridges (but not stayed at the last one). | I haven't written any reports on the other hotels even though they were all excellent. However I am taking the time to write a few lines about our stay at the Dorchester because it was exceptionally good. Above the norm for a five star hotel. | The greeting, the room, the service, the food, the ambiance - in fact every aspect of our stay was perfect. | We didn't eat in the restaurant as we were going to the theatre but we did have afternoon tea and I have to say that the quality of the food and the standard of service was the finest that we had ever experienced. | The cleanliness of our room and bathroom was beyond reproach and the furnishings and fittings were above and beyond expectations. | There was one small glitch with the iPod dock; the power lead was present but the connection lead between this and the Bose unit was missing so I thought oh well I won't be able to play my own music but it's only one night - it wasn't really that important to us. However, I remembered about this on the way out to the theatre and mentioned it to the concierge in passing. On our return it had been replaced and although not a big deal to me I was able to play my latest downloads after all! | The staff at this hotel made our stay so enjoyable it will be impossible for us not to stay at the Dorchester again on our next trip - funds permitting!","Northampton, United Kingdom",10/24/2012
The Dorchester,4,A favourite hotel for plush acoomodations and good service,"I have stayed three times over the past 2 years at The Dorchester. This is one of the best, value-for-money, hotel in London. The rooms are huge, especially the Deluxe and Executive rooms and most afford really nice views of Hyde Park. The in-room amenities are great even if their DVD-TV-Radio flat screen system is a tad capricious and often needs to be rebooted by the technical staff. Tea, breakfast and room service are just wonderful even if prices are steep. Would definitely return in a heartbeat.Try it and you will not bve disappointed.",paris,10/26/2007
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Wedding,"The service provided by the hotel was excellent from booking in to leaving. The staff were very polite and could not do enough to make you visit special. The rooms were clean and provided very good amenities such as tea/coffee, iron and board, fire sweets/crisps.",Wallsend Tyne And Wear,8/14/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Happy Birthday to me!!!,"My husband was taking me to see Warhorse in London for my birthday and my kids paid for us to stay at the Mondrian. What strikes you first about this hotel is the quirky nautical touches. From the beaten copper sweeping walls of the hotel reception desk, the porthole style mirrors in the restrooms, the yellow submarine hanging over the bar in the restaurant. It makes for an interesting environment to stay and relax in. It makes the hotel very individual. | The staff were extremely attentive, without being intrusive and nothing was too much trouble. There is parking at the hotel which is on a first come etc basis. If that is full there is a car park close by. | We had a standard room which was extremely comfortable,had everything you could need and was extremely quiet. The hotel is within easy walking distance of many of the South bank attractions. We explored The Tate and The Globe. A taxi into the West End was quick and only £10 ( including tip) so ok for a treat. | I can highly recommend the cocktails in the Dandylyan Bar, albeight the lighting is extremely subtle. | Unfortunately the roof top Rumpus Room is closed on a Sunday and Monday night so we didn't get to experience that which was disappointing. | Would highly recommend this hotel and it's lovely staff.",norfolk,2/23/2016
The Rembrandt,4,Lovely Hotel,"We loved the Rembrandt! Excellent location, across from the V&amp;A, many delightful restaurants nearby. Our room was clean and large (esp. by London standards) and our marvelous bathroom had a tub in which I could sink up to my neck in bubbles. The staff was friendly and helpful. Only a couple blocks to Harrod's and the neighborhood is wonderful. The only downfall was the street noise. It was a beautiful summer day so we wanted our big huge windows open, but the noise and fumes from the vehicles below was both deafening and nauseating. However, it was well worth the view of a beautiful London street. We loved it and plan to return next spring.",NA,6/30/2004
The Savoy,4,Not quite perfect but still great,"Our 3rd stay at the Savoy and this time we were in a family suite as we had our 2 adult boys with us and the room was ideal for us. This is a magnificent hotel and overall we had a fabulous experience. Room was large and well set up, the second room was certainly large enough for the 2 double beds and the luggage etc. The overall feel in the hotel is historical elegance. Wifi was excellent. This time though there were elements that were ""un-Savoy"" based on our previous stays ... small things and they didn't really detract from the stay at all but it wasn't quite what we had experienced before. We stayed for 3 nights and the mini-bar was never restocked, at breakfast on the first day they ""forgot"" my wifes order of eggs and 30 minutes later they ""remembered"", we had a car organised to take us somewhere and when we went downstairs the car had gone, and a relatively annoying one was no tissues or toilet paper in the bathroom late one night which meant calling down at 1:30am in morning (embarrassing) for toilet paper....and even the following evening we noticed no spare roll and a roll almost finished (remember this is a suite with 4 people in 2 rooms sharing a bathroom). As I mentioned none of them a major problem and in fact all would be called ""first world issues"" but it was a step down from previous and it ran across all departments in the hotel it begs the question as to whether something is going on that has allowed the previous standards to slip. Again though overall we were happy to stay here and the location can't be faulted.","Sydney , Australia",7/16/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,2,Disappointed returning guest,"Returning guests should have their details show up immediately &amp; all areas of the hotel should share the booking details,which by anyone's 5th visit should be apparent that they won't change. | The lack of communication between restaurants &amp; reception was atrocious.",NA,5/8/2017
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Excellent Top Quality Hotel And Customer Care,"I have just had a fantastic 4 day stay with the Apex London Wall Hotel, it was excellent in every way. First being meet by a smilie friendly doorman, then reception who couldn't have been more helpful and courteous. The bedrooms are beautiful, beds are comfortable, they are very clean smart and the hotel is very quiet. The breakfast was top quality and they have an extensive menu the girls who served us were also welcoming, friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble its been a lovely experience and I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to stay in London whether its for sight seeing, business or just a family occasion. Well done London Apex Hotel top marks, I will definitely be back to stay.","Cardiff, United Kingdom",4/9/2013
Corinthia Hotel London,4,Beautiful hotel but a few issues,"We were so excited to stay at this hotel after reading such a good reviews. We had decided that after the wedding we wanted a few relaxing days at a Spa hotel in London to start our honeymoon. | I will start by saying that the hotel is absolutely beautiful and the check in was faultless. We had an issue with the London Marathon being on, which meant there were road closures, however when we rang the hotel explaining the issue, they sent one of the staff to come and meet us at the barrier, to organise for our car to be let through. | Naomi at check in was fantastic and as our room wasn't ready provided us with a glass of champagne each whilst we waited. Once our room was ready she provided us with a detailed room tour, which was very helpful. The one thing we really liked about the Corinthia was the size of the rooms. Our junior suite was very spacious and the bathroom was lovely. At most of the other top hotels the rooms can be quite pokey and worn, this is not the case at the Corinthia! The breakfast was fantastic at the hotel and the room service they provide is very different to other places, which we really loved. Our cooked breakfast was the best we had ever had at a hotel! | Sadly though there were a few issues with our stay. We came back to the room after going to the spa at about 3pm to find that our room had not been cleaned. My husband rang reception to ask if someone could come and sort out the room, however two hours later when we went back to the room and our room had still not been sorted, so my husband had to chase up again. Third time lucky when we came back from dinner in the evening it had been sorted, but this isn't something I would expect from a top London hotel. | Our other issue was to do with the Spa, I will add that all the other staff we dealt with were lovely at the hotel, however the Spa staff looked miserable and were not friendly in the slightest. This was the case on both days that we visited the Spa. The Spa have rules in place regarding children but this is definitely not adhered to. There were children screaming and shouting as well as going in the pool areas and sauna where it clearly said they weren't allowed. Again not what you would expect from a top London hotel. Overall we did enjoy our stay at the Corinthia but it was a shame there were a few niggles.","Guildford, England, United Kingdom",5/30/2018
The Dorchester,5,LOVE IT!!!,"Have yet to stay in other hotels but i love this place to the max! | Was speaking to the front office manager, Andreas and he is superbly patient and explained to me the history of the hotel about how the brunei sultan (if i recalled correctly) bought the place, gave it a unique design etc. | More importantly, the hotel boasts the deepest bath-tub one can have. I am a huge huge bath tub fan and being able to sink in one of those is pure bliss | Overall, thumbs up for the service, the place and the location","Hong Kong, China",7/27/2011
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Modern Hip Hotel with a great location,"Our stay at the Mondrian had a very bad start, but they make up for it! After a very long day of travel we arrived late to be told there had been a flood and our room was not available. They shipped us off to another near by hotel and we were very frustrated and unhappy. (not sure if the flood story was real or if they were just overbooked) Turned out the nearby Hotel was the Park Plaza where we were treated very well and given a two bedroom suite with a huge balcony overlooking the London Eye. The next day we returned to the Mondrian and they offered us a complimentary 3 course dinner with wine in their dinning room where we were treated like VIP's. The hotel staff were friendly and the concierge provided excellent service. The hotel is very modern and contemporary and is in an excellent location for exploring the city. The room was not large but well equipped and very comfortable","Toronto, Canada",7/24/2015
The Dorchester,5,Excellent hotel,"This was my first time at the Dorchester and hope to visit again. The location is excellent right across from Hyde Park and a short walk to the Hyde Park Circle Tube stop. The staff were friendly and very helpful. Had breakfast in the lounge and ordered room service, both of which were prompt and yummy! Large rooms with wonderful bathrooms. Just an overall excellent hotel.","Glendale, Arizona",3/26/2009
The Rembrandt,4,relaxed and helpfull,"quiet room, good room, friendly staff, top breakfast, close to museum, restaurants and underground. | -late check in,early breakfast (7 pm), good bed and sleep, breakfast specials and good omelet on demand",NA,4/30/2018
Newham Hotel,1,Not worth the £55 a night,"This is an extremely low quality hotel and not worth the £55 we paid for a night for a twin room. The shared bathroom was not so unclean and had a dirty bathmat and a lock that didn't work!. Also all the room looked ancient and ceiling was damp. | What is really bad was the customer service. They have a stupid rule that visitors are not allowed in their building. This was not mentioned when I booked the room. I went to see my friends in London and they wouldn't let me walk in to the building with my friends. And the. Not even sit in the lounge. And one of the guys at reception kept following me to check that no one has gone in. We spent most of the time away from the hotel anyway which was good. The bed in the room was ok. Also the hotel itself does not look so bad, but the room we stayed in was in a house next door which looked awful. There is an ibis down the road, I think it would be much better value for money. About 15£ extra. | I think the worst part was the guys on duty at night","Rochdale, United Kingdom",5/4/2015
The Dorchester,5,Londres amigable y grandioso,"Estuve en septiembre de este año en hotel te Dorchester ... Fue una experiencia maravillosa .... Frente a Hyde Park , preciosa vista , atendidos como reyes , con el máximo de detalles . El carrito del desayuno lindo como no hay otro . Servicio de toallas y turn down de la pieza a toda hora , servicio de planchado y lustrado permanente. Los conserjes con los mejores datos . El mejor Restaurant chino dentro del hotel ...

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Refubished room- amazing,"Was very lucky to stay Christmas Day in one of the newly refurbished rooms. It was a courtyard suite. The room was bright and the colour scheme was refreshing and relaxing during the day. At night the room felt comfortable and cosy. Doors are solid and secure. lost of storage space with solid wardrobes. Large comfortable bed. Bathroom was brilliant, very nicely laid out with both bath and shower. The design is a lovely blend of modern based on the glory days of travel with a hint of art deco.","London, United Kingdom",2/5/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,"Friendly, lovely hotel","My husband surprised me with a trip to London for the last night of the Proms. We stayed in this wonderful hotel. From the moment we arrived we were greeted in a warm friendly manner, from the doorman to the receptionist. We were given a very quiet room which was spacious, clean and loved the tv in the ensuite. As it was my birthday the hotel sent me a chocolate cake which was delicious. | The only disappointing thing for me was the afternoon tea. My husband had booked this before we arrive at the hotel and it took him 4 phone calls to finally get it booked. Each time he phoned he was told someone would call him back and no one did. Finally he managed to book it, we went at our appointed time to find out that they had given our table to another couple who they thought was us. We ended up sitting at a tiny table in the middle of the room next to large groups of noisy ladies, hotel guests and waitresses constantly walking past our table. This was not the nice relaxing celebration my husband had expected. We asked for the mustard and horseradish to be removed from the sandwiches which wasn't a problem but meant we had to wait a while for our food to come as they needed to make the sandwiches up fresh. Surely you should be making the sandwiches fresh each time. Some of the sandwiches were a little stale and you could tell had been sitting out for a while. The scones were fantastic. There was a good variety of cakes but I would have liked there to be two of each seeing as there were two of us eating. We cut each one in half so we both could try them. Some were nice, some were a bit tasteless. On the whole I wouldn't take afternoon tea here again. | After the Proms we returned to the hotel and went to their cocktail bar. This was fantastic, lovely cocktails, live music, great atmosphere and attentive staff. We ordered some food which was very nice. Lovely way to unwind after a busy day. | Breakfast was great, we ordered from the menu so can't say what the food from the buffet was like. | I would stay here again and would recommend this hotel to my friends. It is in a great location for sightseeing, shopping or going to shows. | Thank you to all the staff for a great experience and making my stay special.","Aberdeen, United Kingdom",9/12/2013
The Savoy,5,2 Night stay,"Absolutely fabulous!!! Grand, oppulent, spotless,magnificent! Not enough superlatives to describe this fantastic establishment! Our stay was perfect in every way from the moment we arrived, the staff are so helpful and attentive to your every request! Nothing is too much trouble. The food is amazing and the whole ambience is something I will remember forever! Many thanks, we will be back soon! | ,","Leicester, United Kingdom",9/5/2016
The Savoy,5,Another fantastic luxury hotel,Best service ever! We had a fantastic stay at The Savoy. My husband picked this for our anniversary. We got a bottle of champagne.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Trendy hotel located next to Thames!,"Beautiful hotel located in a pedestrian area on the Thames. Rooms are spacious, decorated with taste, clean and quiet! | The hotel has an excellent restaurant and two lively bars. The view is amazing, Thames and its boats ... 5 minutes from the Tate modern museum and 10 minutes walking from many musical theaters. I really enjoyed the stay, the walk around the river and the many restaurants available around ! | Really great location beautiful hotel !",Geneva,1/13/2018
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",4,Very Enjoyable stay,"We had a very enjoyable stay in this hotel . The location is perfect for anyone who is travelling from heathrow airport and also convenient for central London. | The hotel itself is easy to find , clean , comfortable and modern. | The rooms were small even by London standards . | Cocktail bar is gorgeous and the service was excellent . | I thought breakfast was over priced . | Checkin and checkout were straightforward and staff were lovely",Dublin,4/8/2014
The Savoy,5,Tip top drinks in august surrounds,"We visited the Savoy's American Bar to join my mother and father in law who were staying at the hotel for an anniversary treat. The Savoy's famed refit was suitable impressive, the furnishings and general design are clean and classic with plenty of nods to the immense history of the place; including photographs and paintings from many a celebrity visit. In fact there is a little museum space just off the corridor to the bar where you're reminded this hotel has been frequented by the royal family as much as Grace Kelly and Cary Grant! The bar was very nice, plush chairs, good service and great cocktails, all suitably expensive. We did note it was rather cold sitting under the air conditioning unit but the staff were attentive. Naturally you have to go here - for regency splendour and a taste of classic London.",London,5/16/2012
The Rembrandt,4,Lovely hotel in a popular location,We stayed here as part of our 10th wedding anniversary celebrations and it certainly suited the occasion. The hotel is ideally situated opposite the V and A and minutes from South Kensington tube. It is a quiet oasis away from the bustle of Museum London and the madness that is Harrods/Knightsbridge. | We had a deluxe room and it was a good size. The bed was enormous and very comfortable. My only complaint was the air con unit in the room was noisy and couldn't be completely shut off. It took me 24 hrs to get the room temp sorted as it was baking hot but luckily the windows here open! | Linen quality is excellent and dressing gowns are a nice touch. The complimentary toiletries were good quality. Our room was not in the refurbished part of the hotel so the bathroom still possesses the bidet and whirlpool bath and the floor to ceiling marble - all in keeping with the hotel's 'luxury' feel but a little dated. The toilet flush was rubbish! | Given that the hotel was very busy it was very quiet and we were not disturbed by banging doors/other guests. The blackout curtains also work a treat so a good night's rest can be had. | Breakfast included a good selection of hot/cold items. The lift displays do highlight peak times for breakfast and I would avoid the 10-11 slot on Sunday if you prefer a quieter affair. | The lounge bar is really lovely and very relaxing. We enjoyed a few quiet hours reading the papers and having a well deserved drink or too! | This Hotel knows it's getting it right and it's understated elegance makes it a lovely oasis of calm away from the chaos outside. | We'd happily visit again.,Essex,10/24/2016
The Dorchester,5,If only there were 6 stars,"Attended a conference in London and took the opportunity to stay at the Dorchester. From the professional and equally friendly greeting by the door team, this experience continued throughout our stay. The room exceeded expectations and the icing on the cake was a 'Dorchester' bookmark placed in my bedside book by the turn down team. | After taking the opportunity to see a musical, we returned to have roomservice and regardless that it was mid night, the service and quality was superb. | My final comment is that I've never stayed in a hotel with such soft and comfortable pillows. Your head 'melts' into them and anybody thinking of treating themselves to a stay, I would personally highly recommend this hotel",Lymington,1/18/2013
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Ottimo hotel nella City,"L'hotel si trova nel (nuovo) quartiere finanziario vicino alla Bank of England, a soli 5 min. a piedi dalla fermata Bank del tube. La struttura è modernissima - boutique/business hotel -, molto comforevole e lo staff era molto gentile. Forse unica nota negativa è stato il cibo a cena, purtroppo veramente niente di particolare: scelta poco ampia e di qualità mediocre. In compenso la colazione è veramente variata e di ottima qualità con buffet continentale e la scelta di un piatto caldo inglese (per esempio la famosa full english breakfast,...).","Faido, Switzerland",9/4/2013
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,5,Stylish 5 star hotel,"Had a chance to stay in their suit on the 8th floor with stunning view across Hyde park and the side views towards Houses of Parliament and London eye. | Very stylish modern chic design, great service, very good restaurant and bar on site as well as the sister Dorchester 15 steps away, and excellent location overall. | Perhaps one minor thing - we could not play the radio from hotels iPad onto the lovely Bang and Olufsen TV and there did not seem to be an iPod dock or something of the kind. The rest is great, can't fault anything really and the fact that the hotel is on the small side adds up to the luxury feel. The hotel is not cheap either.","London, United Kingdom",5/15/2017

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",2,We don't recommend this hotel,"We stayed in this hotel few days in june, we picked it mainly for the location being at a fair distance from Central Park. The room we had was really very small, maybe the smallest i've been to, no complimentary water. The day we arrived, there was a water leak in the reception. Really we were expecting much more from this hotel. There are probably better options in the same area.","Paris, France",8/31/2016
The Rembrandt,5,Fantastic few days stay at the Rembrandt,"We have just returned from the Rembrandt after a wonderful few days. The location was brilliant just over the road from the V&amp; A and the Natural History Museums. We walked to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, Harrods and shopping was just a five minute walk. | The Club room we had was a decent size but still cosy it overlooked the V&amp;A Museum. Neil Cowen was particularly pleasant and helpful, he booked several things for us including a play, Kensington Palace and the Tower of London. We saved a few pounds booking through the hotel. Because we booked directly through the hotel we received a drinks voucher each for the bar. We will definitely stay at the hotel again.",NA,1/11/2018
The Rembrandt,4,Ideal base for a city break,"We spent a night here on a theatre trip to London. The location makes this hotel a strong contender if you're looking for somewhere central, well served by tubes and buses, in an attractive part of town. Our room was very clean and comfortable and commensurate with its four star rating, but given what it cost I'd have been upset with anything less! If you're visiting on expenses the cost is probably not a great consideration but as a private visitor I would say that, value for money-wise, the Rembrandt was average for a 4* hotel.",East Sussex,11/10/2012
The Savoy,4,Well located for theatre district,"The Savoy has recently undergone an extensive renovation. It's a well located establishment for the theatre district and Covent Garden area, including the Royal Opera House. Located on the Strand toegther with several theatres and many shops, it has definite advantages. The room (rather expensive) I stayed in for 2 nights was small, but well-appointed, with HD TV, free internet for Fairmont Presidents Club members, and the normal complement of amenities for this class of hotel. I did not have a chance to eat at any of the restaurants as my business group arranged breakfasts, but the buffet we were given was not particularly interesting. The labyrinth that one has to go through from check in to rooms is long, with many stairs, and no elevators until one gets to the annex.","London, United Kingdom",6/18/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Excellent place for our weekend stay!,"My last stay at the hotel was nothing short of amazing. On the arrival we were recommended that we upgrade our room to a suite facing river Thames. This was a great choice especially for the spacious interior, modern equipment and lovely views. | All the staff were lovely and professional and I can't forget to mention Zaira for her great recommendation, professional and warm welcome making our stay at Mondrian extremely enjoyable. | I definitely recommend this place.",NA,3/11/2017

The Savoy,5,Disabled access,"I attended a function here, for cats protection. I use a powerchair, so the disabled access was an issue, but the staff was amazing. An on arrival they were all aware where I had to be at what time, and had people ready to show me where to go to escort me down the corridors and the lifts. Which are just amazing, and something to be seen in themselves, the first electric lift with golden doors is lovely. | And the staff would show me to the toilets at any given time, without me having to wait about. | They catered well to my allergies, and were so good when I asked if they could double check about an allergy query. | I didn't use the guest rooms here, as it was a day function, but the staff couldn't do enough for you, especially the Greek man (he even told me he is Greek but not his name, so hopefully I'm ok to put he is Greek. He was so friendly though.he spent most time with me. Used to be agency first now on staff books. Shoutout to him). | I got to meet the black cat of the savoy cat too. | The place is something to be seen, little quirks which will memorable for all the correct reasons. | A much enjoyed visit, thank you to all staff who helped with the function.","Norwich, United Kingdom",8/4/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Modern and super convenient,"It locates at the heart of the city. Most of the attraction spots are in walking distance.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Fantastic experience,"Celebrating a special birthday so arranged a stay at the Mondrian. The hotel lives up to its' ratings. The staff were great, the rooms amazing - views over the Thames and St Paul's Cathedral. The bed was the most comfortable I have slept in. Had a relaxing time in the Spa. Meal at Sea Containers was excellent and cocktails in the Dandelyan to finish. It was an experience I won't forget.",Enfield,2/2/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,Birthday Treat,"Excellent location, great staff, great food, excellent room (apart from air conditioning). | Would certainly stay again. Loved the nautical theme most appropriate given the buildings previous use. Really enjoyed the Rumpus Room and what a view. | | | | |","Greater London, United Kingdom",9/26/2015
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",4,A delight!,"From the welcome you get to the time you check out, this is a very good place. | A good staff and very good room service, breakfast and dinner with a very good bar. | Although I only stayed one night, I highly recommend the Hotel Xenia. | Only drawback is the size of the room I got, but that was not the largest they have. | A very good hotel with a very good staff.",NA,6/18/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,"new and trendy, location can be problematic","Overall its a very nice and trendy hotel. great bars, young people, good vibe. free wifi works well, service is good, room was very nice and spacious. Location - depending what you are looking for. if yo are after the soho and village areas stay elsewhere. if you are after galleries - this is the place for you. during the day there were construction noises (drilling) which was annoying. huge building being built across the road but doesn't interfere too much.","Tel Aviv, Israel",6/28/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,The most Luxurious & Glamorous Hotel in London !!!,"Stayed here for a special occasion recently and it is without exception the most luxurious hotel in London. | I have stayed at all of the other famous 5 star hotels in London and wanted something really special this time so picked The Corinthia. | I was so impressed with the customer service from the initial contact with reservations on helping me choose the perfect room (which was the stunning Trafalgar Suite) and the five million questions I had, to the thoughtful extra touches they did to make my trip 'personal and special' and the attention to detail from 'every' single member of staff helped make a very special birthday celebration 'unforgettable' !!! | I am a self confessed Hotel Snob and make no apologies for wanting a 5 star service. The Corinthia Hotel was absolutely perfect, and try as I might I can't fault it !!! | She is literally the diamond in Londons crown right now and other hotels in Central London need to up their game to keep up ! | The decor is 'stunningly glamorous', customer service 'outstanding', restaurants 'Amazing', and the largest award winning Spa in London !!! A girls Heaven !!! | I loved it so much I've invented a reason to back again in a few weeks ;)","Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",11/3/2014
The Lanesborough,5,Beautiful Hotel with Great Service,"Staying at the Lanesborough is a special treat, with butler service and wonderful library bar. The interior of the rooms and social areas are excellent. The Garden Bar is gorgeous. Love visiting here.","London, United Kingdom",9/8/2017
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,"Stylish, well planned out rooms with excellent service","We stayed at Apex London Wall for the weekend and were really impressed with the whole package. The staff at check in were friendly and knowledgeable. The room was very stylish with branded details such as Bose sound doc and Artimede lighting. The layout of the room also meant it felt very large and was immaculately clean. The hotels' closeness to Liverpool, Moorgate and Bank stations allowed for an easy stay and there were plenty of cabs on the main road.The fact that the city is really quiet over the weekend also meant that after 11.00am on Saturday morning their was free parking outside the hotel which was a real bonus. We've spent a lot more money on accommodation in London in the past and have not been nearly as impressed as we were with Apex.","Lee, United Kingdom",10/24/2011
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,How thoughtful,"My daughter and her friend visiting London . A special trip for these NHS staff . The Customer Services at The Sea Containers exceeded all expectations. No wonder it is our favourite hotel in London. Thank You Amy and Nelson for always responding promptly , and more importantly, caring about your guests .",stockport uk,11/17/2017
The Dorchester,5,Another level .,"Dorchester is known for its service. | But evertime they top it. The way everyone knows your name from housekeeping to waiters. | Attention to your way of doing things is amazing. Example. Im left handed. So they put my coffee on left side and note That im lefty i never said anything. | Consierge are amaizing will get you anything. I went to consierge to ask where can i buy shoelaces. And he opened up the drawer. And ask me ""which color sir"" | And had perpect one for me right there. That was pretty cool had to share it.","Tel Aviv District, Israel",10/19/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Luxurious Weekend in London,"This was our second stay at the hotel and it continued to meet our expectations. On arrival, we were offered a complimentary room upgrade from Superior King to a Deluxe King. As our son was staying with us, we opted for a further room upgrade to Executive King at an additional cost of £60 plus £20 for breakfast. Despite a late check in, the hotel swiftly arranged an extra bed for our son and arranged for a small birthday cake for my husband, which was greatly appreciated. Our room was beautiful and we loved the bed, underfloor heating in the bathroom, the power shower and bathroom amenities (ESPA). My husband spent the entire day at ESPA Life at Corinthia London and loved every minute of it. My son and I joined him after a day of shopping and absolutely loved the Thermal Floor with their indoor swimming pool, vitality pool, amphitheatre sauna, ice fountain, marble heated loungers and private sleep pods. The vitality pool is my favourite part of the Spa and although sad to leave, I left relaxed and refreshed. As we had checked out earlier in the day, we used the spa Change and Chill areas and had access to a wide range of amenities to ensure a smooth stay. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful. A special thanks to Raphael at Reception desk for a smooth check-in and Sunny for assisting us during check-out/visiting the Spa. A very special weekend and most definitely will return!","Mountsorrel, United Kingdom",10/24/2017
Hartley Hotel,3,hotel level is fair to the rate of it.,"It was just 1 night there but honestly the reception staff are very good and helpful ,rooms very small but clean . | In general I will never go back there because the level of other guests there . | You feel it's may be dangerous at night.","Carlisle, United Kingdom",2/25/2017
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Wonderful hotel,Mandarin oriental hotel in Knightsbridge is an exceptional hotel. I stayed here many years ago when it was simply the Hyde Park hotel- it exuded luxury then but was becoming a little faded around the edges. Under Mandarin ownership this large and impressive hotel has been moved forward to a more modern understated luxury but without destroying its historic ties and feel- it really works ! Architecture is stunning and hotel has tremendous curbside appeal. - it only gets better when you enter the building-staff are very customer focussed and top quality in all areas of hotel. Addition of Heston restaurant takes the food here to another level. Of course its top dollar to stay here but you will have a very memorable and enjoyable visit and u will want to return.,"Malaga, Spain",1/20/2018
The Savoy,3,The Thrill is Gone,"There's always a bit of a fantasy that one hopes to experience as a guest, a bit of a little white lie that we tell ourselves: that we are a special guest to the hotel. As guests we want to forget that there have been hundreds, thousands before us. The Savoy fails miserably in providing one with this sense of uniqueness. The hotel room we were in had a side table that looked as if it had been kicked around by a rugby club. The marble in the bathroom was stained by liters of water that had been left standing on it for days on end. The tiny room was overall uninviting. You just felt like a fool for having agreed to plunk down so much money for the ""experience.""","Hilversum, The Netherlands",9/8/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,I hate to be an echo...,"IWe stayed here for four nights in September. While I have occasionally found some TripAdvisor reviews to be hyperbolic, that is not the case here. | All of the usual benchmarks get uniformly high marks for excellence. The rooms are largish --itself distinguishing among London hotels--with bathrooms with double sinks, a profusion of fluffy towels , a separate shower and enormous tub . (Searching for something to quibble about, the shower is a tad smallish, but the rain shower is wonderful.)The policy that promises your room will be ready whenever you arrive is precisely that. And a marvelous boon to the jet-lagged arriving at Heathrow overnight from the U.S.If you have ever sat around a hotel lobby waiting while your room is readied you will appreciate this initial courtesy. And things do not go down hill from there. | Service was attentive and friendly, but never pretentious. The business center provides free access to computers so you can keep in touch, if you feel you must. Food at the Northall restaurant was very good. We ate at the bar at some point on our first day and discovered Meantime lager, brewed in Greenwich. (The reference took a while to dawn.) | The Corinthia is on the edge of Covent Garden which means you can walk to any number of interesting restaurants. It is also just a block away from the tube, which offers both swift transportation and immersion in non-tourist London. | Oh, and here's a quibble. The concierge staff recommends all the dining places you've heard of but none that you haven't. If they have a list of recommended restos and wine bars we never saw it. Perhaps such a list, updated quarterly, could be available to guests who request it? (This is quite a popular feature at the Four Season Buenos Aires.) | In sum, a splendid experience. Will it be as good next time? | We are certainly going to find out.",New York,9/23/2012

Apex London Wall Hotel,4,A very enjoyable weekend in London,Our two nights at the Apex Hotel were excellent. The service from all the staff was superb and we were made to feel very comfortable at all times. Best hotel bed I have ever slept in and the breakfasts were splendid. | The location is ideal for the City of London and it is just a short walk to St Paul's Cathedral. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in this area of London. | |,"Caterham, United Kingdom",1/9/2013
Rhodes Hotel,1,Da sconsigliare,"a parte la buona posizione e la pulizia accettabile, per il resto terribile. Siamo stati ospitati nella depandance distante 200 metri e in un'altra strada. Quarto piano di scale ripide in sottotetto, stanza e letti strettissimi. Sala da pranzo per la colazione al limite della decenza, in alcuni momenti si faceva il passamano delle tazze e dei piatti. Pancetta e uova con supplemento di 6 sterline.","Parma, Italy",5/15/2013
The Savoy,5,Outstanding Experience,"The hotel stay was superb from beginning to end. I had done some research before arrival regarding two points that keep being raised on tripadvidor and both were sorted prior to arrival by an excellent customer service team. Firstly the wifi, if you join the presidents club, enrollment is free and you get your wifi free too. I asked for tea and coffee making facilities and on arrival all the necessary was in place. So stop whining about the wifi and coffee all it takes is an email, Anyway back to my experience. | Check in was a breeze, once we found exactly where it was! A member of staff directed us as we were looking a bit bemused in the foyer. We were shown to the elevator by the member of check in staff and given directions to our room, but we're not shown personally. But hey it's not that difficult, follow the signs. | We had room 519 which was a deluxe King room overlooking the courtyard and decorated in an Edwardian style. OK the view from the room is not the best but who cares we weren't there for the room view. The room was pretty large with a light and airy feel and had lost of wardrobe and storage space. Large marble bathroom with all amenities including a full size bath. As the room had a little entrance area with a door it was impossible to hear anything from outside the room it was probably the quietest hotel room I've ever stayed in, fantastic nights sleep in a very large King bed, be warned though it's a high bed but super comfy. | We had a room deal that included breakfast and wow was it a breakfast with excellent freshly cooked items, fresh juices and excellent coffee. The waiting staff for breakfast were first class, very attentive, we never had to ask for anything they were always there before having to be asked. The staff are actually one of the best points of the hotel, they were always smiling, friendly and willing to help. Even when you met staff in the corridors they would stop, step to one side greet you and wait for you to pass, very nice. You really never need to ask anything from the staff they will always step forward and offer assistance before you get the opportunity. Now that's service. | We ate in Kaspars and used the Beaufort Bar and I have reviewed them seperately. OK the hotel is not cheap, but that's probably a good thing in the long run for obvious reasons. It was a fantastic memorable stay even though it was only one night. Thank you The Savoy.","Market Deeping, United Kingdom",2/20/2015

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Just Perfect,"Our 3rd visit to this amazing hotel and I have to say that the standards that we experienced before are very much still in place. The personal touch at check in is very subtle as the team member gets to know you and offers advice on what he believes may help based on the information you have offered. This sets the tone for what lies ahead. The rooms are of an excellent standard and very well appointed with quality toiletries and an amazing shower. The bedding on the very comfortable beds is crisp and welcoming. This trip was to celebrate a birthday and the hotel did not let this go unnoticed as a delicious treat was waiting in our room on arrival. The rooftop bar on level 12 is well worth a visit, it is vibrant, friendly and offers the most spectacular views of the city. Sea Containers restaurant offers an excellent breakfast with a choice to satisfy everyone. | This remains our hotel of choice for visits to London as it is perfectly situated on the South Bank within easy walking distance of the West End, Regent and Oxford St. looking forward to our next visit!","Andover, United Kingdom",2/17/2018
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Everything was sensational,"Stayed here for a Saturday night and everything was perfect. Stayed in a junior suite which was a great size. The bar in the evening was great, good service and ambiance and the breakfast in the morning was delicious. Hope to be lucky enough to stay here again some time.","West Sussex, United Kingdom",9/7/2016
Rhodes Hotel,1,Avoid this hotel!,"I stayed in this hotel in November 2006 with a friend and we were throughly disapointed. The hotel's website does not show it how it really is and the en-suite bathroom is practical a small box in the corner. We were placed on the top floor where our room was the only furnished one and the others were still being built. One afternoon, we returned to the hotel to find our room was open and the builders were using our doorway to store their tools! This was obviously unacceptable as we had left valuables in our room seeing as we did not think people would be in there, apart from perhabs a cleaner. To let people into our room, i thought was disgraceful of the owner and i would NEVER recommend anyone to go to this hotel.",Birmingham,3/26/2007
The Savoy,5,A dream to stay!,"I have to say my whole family were made very welcome. I found the staff approachable and helpful! We as a family were staying for a very special family event and just loved it. We enjoyed afternoon tea all 9 of us. I thought it was lovely. The srambled egg choice was a little small but lets face it I was fast running out of room! We had drinks at the American bar ( i think thats what it was called?) Drinks were fine and the prices we as to be expected of such a London hotel, but I just found the service slow. If you ordered a cocktail it seemed to take forever. I think more so if you werent sitting near the bar you werent being entertained by watching the bar man make it up which propably made it seem longer. I usually stay in Mayfair or Piccadilly so I found the location out of the way to my favourite haunts, but it was a small price to pay for the lovely hotel!",NA,3/12/2013
Corinthia Hotel London,4,"London, Up Close. But Just.","The British Parliament, Big Ben, South Bank, Westminster, London Eye, Thames, Trafalgar Square, etc etc. You get it right? | These are all the places one likes to visit once in London. Now what if your hotel is not minutes, but steps away from there? That's Corinthia for you. | I was on a business visit to London this September and stayed over at the Corinthia. | Now for the hotel itself. To put it mildly, it is old. Really Really old. | In fact parts of hotel were so old I wouldn't be surprised if the government ordered carbon dating to determine age. | Rooms - especially the one I got - 104 was it? They are small. Way small for a super luxury hotel. It had a tall ceiling - now only if that could compensate for the lack of space. | What's surprising was the room layout. You enter, left is the cupboard, on your right is your room, bear left and you would see a bathroom half the size of the room. I mean, who does that. | If that wasn't enough, the bath tub has a TV that plays out hotel advert with music blaring out from the ceiling speakers. Surely we could have lived without that. | The real cool thing though was ceiling mounted hot water sprinklers - that was nice. | On the outside, the lift informs you of the floors not by using a digital meter, but a huge dial. | Now many would say - it adds to the charm for those who romance things in period. For those type of people - it can be home away from home. | Corinthia had nice open areas in the middle of the building. Just gave the hotel rooms some breathing space. | In all, Thank you Corinthia for being so close to every place a person wants to see in London. You saved me my journey in the tube, the bus, a taxi to see all the iconic places.",NA,9/18/2015
Rhodes Hotel,4,"Vriendelijk personeel, mooie locatie","De kamer was zeer recent gerenoveerd en lag op de tweede verdieping boven de receptie. Erg schoon en compleet. Het enige wat erop aan te merken was, was dat de temperatuur van het water in de douche moeilijk te reguleren was en later op de ochtend (09.00) was het gewoonweg lauw. | Het ontbijt vond plaats in de kelder en was best uitgebreid (continentaal). Ik kan me voorstellen dat in periodes waarin er meer kamers zijn verkocht, het best een krappe ruimte is voor al die mensen. Het personeel was ten alle tijden erg vriendelijk en behulpzaam, 24 uurs receptie was fijn. Het hotel lag op korte loopafstand (5 min) van de metro met goede verbinding. Erg mooie wijk, grenzend aan Hyde Park.",NA,1/11/2016
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,Anniversary Games so where else would we stay?,"Attended Olympic Anniversary games on Sunday so decided to stay again at the Apex London Wall as we did for the Olympics last year. We arrived on a sticky afternoon to be met with ice cold fruit punch at reception.Immediate upgrade to a suite as room was not quite ready. The service at this hotel is exemplary. The staff are professional, polite, helpful and friendly. The hotel is spotless, the suite was spacious and well equipped. I managed to avoid consuming the entire mini bar this time!

Definitely loved the food over everything.",Ireland,12/31/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,4,What a location,"I just spent 5 nights on the fourteenth floor but did not eat or drink at the hotel, although the bar looked a lot of fun. The great thing about the hotel is the location - right on the river with the most stunning waterfront left and right. The road entrance is actually not on the river, and there is no nameplate, so I walked past before realising what was what. Staff are super friendly (maybe too much so for old introverts like me) and it is nice to stay in a good, modern hotel in London with lots of nice touches and lighting you can easily turn on and off without having to hunt round for ages. But what makes the difference here is that river front, and if you fancy a walk or a jog it is a magnificent and uplifting experience.","Tokyo, Japan",10/11/2014
The Rembrandt,5,Lovely welcoming hotel,"A lovely hotel, ideally located to Imperial College which we were visiting. My daughter and I had a comfortable twin room to the rear of the hotel, Currently the room is overlooking some building works but I think in the future that will not be an issue. The reception staff were friendly and helpful and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. I plan to stay at The Rembrandt the next time I visit. It is a very convenient location for the general area.","Waterford, Ireland",5/26/2016
The Rembrandt,4,"Excellent location, small room","This is in an excellent location, right opposite the museums. We hadn't stayed in this part of London before and we would stay here again.

However, we did have views of the museums from our room.",NA,6/14/2017
The Savoy,5,Must Stay,"My husband and I stayed for one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it was amazing, we were so relaxed that it felt as if we had been there for the whole weekend.

We will be going back again. | Central location for theaters, Convent Garden and lots more...brilliant. | A BIG thank you!!!!!!!","Brighton, United Kingdom",10/4/2014
The Savoy,3,"Disappointed, just wanted to relax with a beer.","Top notch service, the staff cant do enough for you. | Everything about the building and staff was perfect. | The only thing that let the hotel down is that even if you are a resident you have to join a waiting list to get into the bar. | This means that people can walk in off the street and enjoy a drink while residents have to go to their room and call room service for a drink. | Ive stayed in budget hotels in the past and have been able to get a drink at the bar so why when i pay about £400 (cant remember the exact amount) per night at the Savoy can i not do this simple thing? | For this reason we will not be visiting the Savoy again.","Shrewsbury, United Kingdom",8/12/2012
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Christmas party,"I visited here with work colleagues for a Christmas party. Everything was very impressive; from the decor and service, to the food and facilities. The staff couldn't be more helpful, we hired the cinema area downstairs and used the cinema itself for a work presentation, had the lounge area to ourselves for drinks and then one of the studios for a 3 course Christmas meal. Classy venue and not a Christmas hat in sight. Will be back for a meal and maybe a nights stay soon.","Farnham, United Kingdom",12/4/2015

Thank you Ben for the amazing service and whoever makes the desserts has been sent from heaven! We had the lava cake with the best chocolate I've ever tasted, the home made ice cream was delicious and washed down with the Mendoza Malbec and a couple of cocktails.

Thoroughly enjoyed our visit &amp; we will back, thank you.","London, United Kingdom",8/26/2018
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,4,Jazz Bar,I went to watch some Jazz on a Saturday night. The service was excellent and the drink well priced. Extremely comfortable surrounding. I didn't stay or eat at the hotel but the menu looked appealing. It's a public bar which is excellent however there was rather a lot of mess in the toilets which is not the staffs fault but could perhaps do with closer monitoring. However an excellent experience otherwise. Wonderful staff and building. Some of the patrons could try smartening themselves up though.,"Royston, United Kingdom",12/7/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Superb!,"We held my wife's 40th birthday party at the hotel in January 2015. The level of service was exceptional. Special praise should be directed to Sonia Hicks who assisted with every aspect of the organisation. Some of the ladies started the day in the Agua Spa and all agreed it was their favourite ever spa experience, one of them even wanted to take Frederic from the spa home with her! We enjoyed cocktails in the Dandelyan bar which were all well made and delivered quickly despite the bar being busy on a Saturday night. This review also needs a big shout to Sam from Curzon cinemas who allowed us to show a special film for my wife at the cinema in the hotel's basement. We then ate in a private dining room in the Sea Containers restaurant and all agreed that the food was exceptional. Lastly we finished the night in the Rumpus Room bar which was a great place to ensure a lively finish. This is without doubt a fashionable place to hang out but the staff are friendly, engaging and incredibly helpful without any of the stuffiness often associated with high quality hotels. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Mondrian to anybody.","London, England.",2/26/2015
Apex London Wall Hotel,5,March 2018 trip,"Good location for business. Rooms were clean and comfortable, efficient, lovely modern décor and very functional, friendly service.

Very disappointing experience over all, Lovely settng though and good service. Breakfast was great. | On checking in i did ask if i needed to make a reservation for the Cocktail bar and Rumper Room, l was told no.

Hell No, But i did ask the receptionist if i had to and she said NOOOOO!!!! | Having then made a rumpus on both occasions, we where found seating, Other guest where turned away, We noted There where empty tables around the both Bars. Having stayed 1 hour in each bar, Said empty tables where still empty on leaving. SO ANNOYING . Would not go back to Drink or Eat. But would go back for the Hotel Experience.

The Rembrandt,5,Great Mother and Daughter Trip,"My mother and I stayed at the Rembrandt for 6 nights in December. We had a wonderful experience. Our room was nice and cozy. The daily breakfast was a great way to start the day. The hotel was decorated beautifully for the Christmas season. The hotel staff at the front desk, was excellent in booking my car service to and from the airport, and helping me navigate the train system, so we could take trips outside the city. The hotel was walking distance to Harrods ( which is a block away), Hyde Park, and museums. We even walked to Buckingham Palace and Big Ben. We did not use the tube, but there were multiple tube stations nearby. I would defiantly stay at this hotel again or any of it's sister properties. I had no complains. We have a lovely time.","West Palm Beach, Florida",2/8/2016

We had views over the river, a beautiful outside space along with the biggest bed I've ever seen, beautiful furniture, and a luxurious bathroom. Staff are superb and help provide an experience that is a cut above the rest. Yes the price is high but you absolutely get what you pay for. We also made use of the spa which is a little on the small side but highly functional and feels like a real retreat. We chose not to have breakfast as there are lots of (much cheaper) nice eateries within walking distance. I cannot recommend the Corinthia highly enough.","London, United Kingdom",3/8/2014
Ridgemount Hotel,4,Preis-/Leistung und Lage top,"Ein für London typisches Stadthotel mit engen Treppenhäusern und noch engeren Zimmern. Dafür aber in sehr guter Lage in der Nähe vom British Museum, Oxford Street und Covent Garden zentral und doch ruhig genug gelegen. Die Zimmer und Bäder sind einwandfrei, nur eben recht eng. Das Frühstück ist typisch britisch, der Service sehr familiär und herzlich. Dazu preislich wirklich gut.","Hannover, Germany",5/5/2014
The Savoy,2,shabby,"I stayed for three nights in a supposedly superior room at over £300 per night. The room overlooked a courtyard full of pipes and grotty machinery with a noisy aircon unit just outside my window. I was promised a king size bed - what i actually got were two beds pushed together, all night i kept falling bewteen them. The bathroom radio didnt work and when I turned the tap of the bath, rusty water poured out. The corridor carpets are worn and the whole place needs a revamp. It simply isnt worth the extra cost if you are looking for something a little special (which it isnt) and I get the impression the hotel is resting on its name. The Grill and the American bar have great atmospheres, but as a staying guest at the hotel you dont get any special privaleges. I was turned away from the bar at around 7pm because it was too full - generally with people off the street who have come in for a drink but are not staying. The mangement need to sort their act out if the hotel has any chance of surviving. I would happily go there to eat but not ever again to stay.","Worcester, UK",8/19/2005
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Always A Pleasure,"Your never disappointed when you visit this Restaurant/ Hotel. | Its Summer Time so seated outside is always welcomed-Just something else. | The views are the best, Southbank ( the start of). | We had a mixed starter selection- Padrón Peppers-Sourdough Olives/Roasted Aubergines-Squid. We shared them and that was enough starter. | The Pollock was delicious , likewise the Cheese burger (Always good) Fries-Max Cheese-MAC n Cheese and 2 botes of Pino @ £40 Each. | We went Lunch and watched the Day to settle over the Embankment-Beautiful.","London, United Kingdom",6/19/2018
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",4,Post Cruise London,"Following a 12-day Eastern Mediterranean Cruise, we spent five nights in London. We stayed at the Hotel Xenia which occupies a 19th-century townhouse. This luxury boutique hotel is a 6 minute walk from the Earl's Court tube station and about the exact same distance to the Gloucester Road tube station. We arrived at Heathrow Airport and took the Piccadilly Tube Line to the Earls Court station. This is a must if you have heavy luggage or multiple bags. The Earls Court station has a lift (elevator) from the platform to the street level so you never have to navigate your luggage up stairs or up an escalator, its very convenient. The Gloucester Road tube station has a lift that goes part of the way, but then you still have a flight of stairs to deal with. We used the Gloucester Road station for getting around London but the Earls Court station for going to and from Heathrow airport. | The hotel is a fabulous location and you can easily access any area of London from the two tube stations. You can be in the West End in 15-20 minutes easily. Theres a huge Sainsbury's supermarket right next door to the hotel, its almost like a Walmart. Its open until midnight every night except weekends when it closes earlier. Theres a self-serve Laundromat less than half a block away, and multiple restaurants and shopping on Gloucester Road nearby, including a 24-hour convenience store called Tesco Express. | There are many high end hotels in close proximity. The Marriott is directly across the street, and the Crowne Plaza is a short walk. We loved the area. | The hotel is five-star in almost every way. The rooms are modern and well appointed, the free internet is very fast, and the staff is incredible. The price while not cheap is reasonable by London standards. Theres only one reason we would hesitate to stay here again. The rooms are some of the smallest weve ever stayed in. We are used to small rooms in big cities like New York and London, but this took small rooms to a whole new level. We were coming off of a cruise and our stateroom on the ship was larger than our room at the Xenia. We had two large suitcases and there wasnt even room to put them on the floor. There was a wardrobe rather than a closet, and it held about six hangers. Honestly, it was hard for my wife and me to even move around at the same time. It was downright claustrophobic. | Im not saying dont stay here, as there were so many great things about this hotel, just be prepared for a room the size of a walk-in closet. We will definitely stay in this neighborhood again on future visits to London but will look for a hotel with slightly larger accommodations.","Las Vegas, Nevada",8/9/2016
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Fantastique,"Je voyage souvent dans des hotels 5 é toiles du monde entier et le corinthia de Londres et de loin un de mes préférés. Le personnel est tout simplement parfait. Les chambres sont splendide, modernes mais chaleureuses confortables et trés bien decorees. Les salles de bain en marbre blanc sont très grandes et magnifique.

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,superb stay for less than 24 hours,"Mandarin Knightsbridge is a top class hotel. What really made it for us was the lovely staff. We checked in at 11.00 a.m. on Saturday then went to lunch in Piccadilly and out for the evening checking back in at about 8.30 p.m. to Bar Boulud for a superb evening. Checked in for the night and then checked out at 11.00 a.m. Sunday morning. So hardly there and most of the time asleep BUT the staff are brilliant, welcoming, friendly, interested in you, in a good way. | Highly recommended","Croydon, United Kingdom",11/10/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Outstanding art hotel with a great location and wonderfully appointed rooms,"We had a wonderful stay at the Mondrian London! It was the 3rd hotel in London of our recent trip, and we feel it had the best price-to-value ratio. The hotel lobby is stunning - just check out the pictures on the site! We were visiting on a weekend in January and the restaurants and bars were hopping. Not so much that they felt un-welcoming, but certainly a popular spot. | The rooms were fantastic. We loved that we could connect our phones via in-room bluetooth and listen to our own music. The toiletries were solid and unique, and the bathroom was well appointed. The bed was comfortable; not the most comfortable I've ever slept in, but I give it a 4 out of 5. It was good. The only complaint I have about the rooms were the price of the in-room minibar drinks. I fully understand that mini-bars are expensive. I'm not surprised when I see prices of $5-10 for beers, $8-10 for mini bottles of liquor... It's pretty standard in the industry. But this hotel's mini-bar prices... WOW. They are WAY up there! The drinks sounded inventive so I was curious to try one, but I'm glad I checked the price before I dropped over 20 pounds on a drink. | The hotel staff was friendly. Not warm and welcoming like the folks at the sofitel, but friendly for sure. I wish there was a little more organization to the line at check-in, we had 4 people cut in front of us before we were taken. I will say the bell staff was friendly and took our bags for us upon arrival, but once we got our room keys, they disappeared, so we just grabbed our own luggage off the cart and walked up with it. | We loved the modern-art touches throughout the hotel. The sculptures in the hallways, the backdrops in the elevators - it was great! It felt like everywhere we went there was something new to look at. | Overall impressions - beautiful hotel - fair price for what you get - fantastic rooms - decent staff - amazing location. I'm on the fence between a 4 and 5, mostly because the staff was good but not great, but for the price and location, I'm bumping the rating up to a 5.",Orlando,2/18/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,2,Could have been great but NOPE!!,"To be honest I want to give a higher rating but our last nights stay ruined it. We stayed here for 3 nights... 31st Dec - 02nd Jan. I didn't tell them it was my 21st birthday on the 31st Dec however my partner brought my presents along and banners and everything, i was extremely disappointed when we came back later on in the day when the cleaners had been that no gift of good will was left, it would have been special and nice if you had left me a small glass of champagne, it would have been an extra touch, so you disappointed me there, we spent so much money staying here. Also we got a note that a fire alarm test will go off on 02 Jan at 11am but at 1.35am Monday 02nd Jan the fire alarm went off we panicked and got dressed, was this a real test or the practise?? No one else knew what to do on the floor??!!!! After 10 mins of the alarm going off and on you finally got on your tannoy and said DO NOT EVACUATE THE BUILDING and that someone had set it off accidentally!!! You left that too late!!!!! So thanks for that. You ruined my birthday weekend. Opposite there was also a party going in the room, there wasn't an option to ring down to reception on the room phone??!!! So I had to ring off MY mobile to complain to you and send up security to throw them out. So thanks for waking me up at 1.35am and kept me awake for at least 2 hours after. This is why I am giving you 2 stars. I would not return after this, I expect this in a cheap hotel but not an expensive one.",NA,1/2/2017
Ridgemount Hotel,5,"Great value, great staff, great hotel!","Lovely hotel. Very clean and in a great area. Breakfast was excellent and really surpassed all expectations for a two star hotel. The staff serving breakfast were efficient, but still retained a cheerful attitude. | Lounge area is roomy and comfortable, with free tea and coffee. The owners were happy for us to leave our luggage after checkout and use the room to sit and read whilst waiting for the train (good selection of books to borrow). | The owners were really knowledgeable and helpful, directing us towards transport links and advising us of local events. All the staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful and helped to make our stay really special.",NA,11/8/2016

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,3,Day one of three. Not a great welcome,My wife and I arrived at 930 with two cases and backpacks. Doorway blocked by one or two members of staff. Couldn't get through the revolving door whereupon one of the doorstops realised and pressed a button to open the side door. We dragged our cases up the flight of stairs to reception. It improved slightly but as we stood there at the corner of the desk two other members of staff kept jostling my wife aside to get labels off the counter. Watch the cctv if you are the manager and tell me what you think of the welcome. I did well not to comment but I guessed they weren't bothered. I think there may have been a mumbled apology from the taller one when I looked him in the eye. Some brief explanation of why my card was being charged an extra £300 and you can't refuse to accept it! At least the receptionist asked if we needed help with our cases. I declined as I wasn't sure how long that would have taken. Never mind let's see what tomorrow brings. It's certainly not what I watched mMr Dixon demonstrate on the hotel inspector to Alex Polizzi. Stay tuned I promise photos tomorrow. Rooms are very modern and this a mobile on the desk which says I can use it to call Portugal for freeOla,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",7/22/2016
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Expensive but worth it!,Stayed here with my husband last week for 3 nights to celebrate his 65th birthday.He doesn't like a fuss so didn't mention it to the hotel.We had a beautiful room overlooking Knightsbridge.It was lovely and had everything you would expect.Ok the ceiling and cornices need painting but it is an old.I much prefer this style of room to the trendy minimalist style.Breakfast was fabulous and a delight to sit at the window overlooking Hyde Park.We ate (and drank) twice and the meal was great both times.Everything was perfect and staff very attentive.The young waiter on the Tuesday night was particularly helpful (possibly Thomas?Foreign accent)he recommended a nice Sancerre.We booked on the first night and on the Thursday we didn't have a reservation but the restaurant manager got us seats at the bar until a table became available which want too long.Great food and ambiance.We also had drinks in The Mandarin Bar where again staff were delightful.Overall it would be difficult to find anything at all to fault at this splendid hotel.Yes it is expensive but I think it is worth it.,"Inverness, United Kingdom",10/3/2014
The Savoy,5,"Fun, emotional and memorable New Years vacation","We decided to spend New Years Eve 2017 in London, and we were delighted to go back to the Savoy after 11 years. After all this time, the place even better and the memories from this visit will last forever... for auld lang syne my dear... ! This is a review for an 8 day stay. | The Savoy is a pricey, luxury hotel on the Strand, on the North side of the River Thames across from the London Eye and near Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden and the theatre district. For us this location was perfect. Walking distance to everything we wanted to do. | The Savoy's entrance is offset from the Strand by a half-block long drive-up area. It has a beautiful entrance and the lobby area was beautifully decorated for the holidays, featuring a wealth of eager to please greeters and door people. I checked-in the family in a separate parlor area, seated at a desk, VIP style. | We booked a family room. It's really two adjacent rooms with a shared bathroom. Mom and Dad's room had a cushie king sized bed with desk, large closet, desk, and mini-bar. The kids room was two queen sized beds. Each room had its own door leading to a small shared entry room that connected with the bathroom. | The bath room was large and luxurious. Bathtub, toilet, bidet, shower stall, towel warmers... really very nice, but only setup for one person at a time. | This hotel dates back to the late 1880s, but it has been recently re-habbed. It's decor is true to its history and features nice art work and wall paper. | We used the shoe shine and laundry service. We loved the fine touches from the housekeeping staff. The bell staff helped us check in and check-out. I got regular text messages from the staff asking if everything was okay. I felt pampered. At one point, we texted the word Terrific to the hotel to describe our visit. | Breakfast was included with our room price, and we really enjoyed breakfast. The Savoy serves a complete breakfast menu for all tastes. I enjoyed a omelet and toast every morning, with fresh squeezed orange juice. This was a full service meal, and it usually took an hour or so. That was okay, we learned to wake up a little early to enjoy the whole experience. A couple of times the servers seated us by the windows with a view of the River Thames. After our last day, we were sadly saying goodbye. Thanks for treating us so warmly! | New Years Eve. We reserved a table for our family at the Savoy's New Years Eve celebration dinner. We arrived at 7:30 and didn't leave until 1:30am. We were served a multi-course meal that was spread over several hours. Our desert was served about 11pm. We loved, loved, loved our waiter!! We sat near the live entertainment: a jazz singer and piano. They were delightful! At 11:45, the river side doors were opened, and we all walked outside to the Victoria Embankment. Where were situated straight across the River Thames from the London Eye... The center of London's New Year's celebration. | Midnight. We could hear the music and the countdown to midnight. Happy New Year!! The band led the whole city it in singing Auld Lang Syne while watching the fantastic fireworks show -- very moving, I loved it; I loved the family experiencing it together!. We went back inside and had another bottle of champagne. The entertainment ended and we went to bed. This will be a family memory that will last forever!! | Location. The Savoy is a block away from Covent Garden. This is a delightful and historic open-market shopping and dining area. We had dinner at a restaurant or pub near Covent Garden nearly every night. We just went walking and stopped into some place that looked good. Covent Garden is just a short walk to Leicester Square -- where we saw Star Wars (for me, for the 2nd time). From there it is a short walk to Piccadilly Circus, which was where we did most of our shopping (Regent Street to Oxford Circus). On our first afternoon we walked down the Strand -- its name changes to The Mall -- which leads straight to Buckingham Palace. For us, the hotel was in a perfect spot. | Transportation to airport. From Heathrow, we took the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station; then took a taxi to the hotel. This was ok, but we had 8 days of luggage, so, for our return, we took a taxi straight to Heathrow. Taxis both ways is best. | Tube. The hotel is near two underground stations: Covent Garden and Embankment. The Embankment station is on the District and Bakerloo Lines. Very handy for tourists. But perhaps just as good was Covent Garden underground station; it is on the Piccadilly line; we learned that this line gets very crowded and sometimes it is easier to walk than to jam into a train at rush hour. Either way, two good stations. | Rail. We took trains out of the city to Windsor Castle and Hampton Court Palace. Both times we used Waterloo station. It was right across the river over the Waterloo Bridge from our hotel -- about a 15 minute walk. The station is huge, and you need to get there a little early to find the ticket kiosk and rail line. The trains are new, modern and comfortable. One day, it was particularly rainy and we took a taxi from our hotel to Waterloo Station.","Naperville, Illinois, USA",1/12/2018
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,Outstanding customer service and experience,"My husband and I stayed here for just 1 night on Valentine's Day. We experienced service as if we were guests who stayed for weeks at a time. | Upon arrival at the hotel, the Reservations Manager came to greet us and chat with us, to make sure we were happy. We had upgraded to a suite and we were then given an even better room than the category we booked. | Our room was beautiful, overlooking Hyde Park with french doors and two sets of windows. Our bathroom had a separate shower and bath and was a good enough size. | We spent a few absolutely INCREDIBLE hours in the spa.... I had been years ago and it was by far the best hotel spa I had been to in London (and I'm from London!) and I was curious to see if it was still as good. It didn't disappoint at all and we had the most amazing treatments! | We had dinner at Bar Boloud downstairs and the food was amazing; I'm veggie so I'm often stuck with a risotto or pasta dish or invariably something with butternut squash, but this night they had thought about all diners and I had the most wonderful dinner. | When we left, we did so with a great experience in mind. But this is what really surprised me: | I received the standard post-visit survey and whilst completing it, I did mention that in our room, there was a small area of carpet that looked like it had been missed by housekeeping with the vacuum cleaner. To my amazement, the Executive Housekeeper called me to discuss it, to apologise and to assure me this was normally never the case. | We had a lovely conversation and I was very impressed; a week later, so two weeks after we had stayed, my husband realised that his enormous bottle of Dior aftershave was not at home. This was from their private collection and for aftershave wasn't cheap at around £200 - and he'd hardly used it. | We searched our house and out of desperation, I called the Exec Housekeeper, Susana Fernandez, to ask if there was any chance we had left it there. | To my amazement, she called me to tell me that they had it!!! I know that good hotels should hold onto any items you leave behind, but sadly this has not always been my experience, even in some of the best. | The Mandarin's honesty policy and care for the guest is second to none. We are so impressed and I wanted to share our experience, as we really got a strong sense of their effort for the guest, whether you are staying one night or many. | I'd like to again mention Susana Fernandez, as her communication, professionalism and consideration was superb. | We look forward to staying again soon.","London, United Kingdom",3/6/2015
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",5,The staff is the best !!!,The staff here makes the property a delight. They do everything possible to make you your stay as effortless as possible. The front door staff could give lessons on customer service...they were fantastic !,"Dublin, Ireland",2/14/2015
The Rembrandt,4,Great Location,"Staying in London is always going to be an expensive experience and the Rembrandt is no exception. The room was small and very basic with no individual features you would except from Edwardian Hotel. I would not class this hotel as 4 star luxury if that is what you are seeking. The plus point was a delicious fresh hot breakfast with plenty of choice. The location was perfect for museums, high class stores and Hyde park.",United Kingdom,3/16/2013
The Rembrandt,5,We would stay here again and recommend it to others without hesitation.,"I chose this hotel specifically for its closeness to the V&amp;A, Natural History and Science museums, to the tube/Picadilly Line and good reviews on Trip Advisor, but of of all the hotels I've stayed in, I found this to be one of the most efficient. All staff were friendly and helpful, and were quick to respond to any queries we had. | The only drawbacks were that the bed was a double rather than a king which meant that my partner's feet were hanging off the end of the bed (he being 6 foot 4!). They were willing to move us for a charge, but it was a small issue. The view from the room was also nothing to write home about (a roof), but I guess that's the luck of the draw! | A few touches we noticed - free internet access in the foyer, prompt servicing of rooms in the morning, proper hairdryers, magazines in the room, fresh flowers by the lifts, robes, big mugs for coffee at breakfast and real scambled eggs! | The hotel in general was very well maintained - we didn't spot anything which looked tired or 'out of order'. The ambiance was relaxed and positive. We didn't hear anyone complaining at reception which is a rare event in some of the hotels I've stayed in! A good indicator we thought. | Good value for money given the high standards the hotel clearly has. We would stay here again and recommend it to others without hesitation.",Wales,5/7/2009
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Fabulous Hotel,"What an absolutely fabulous find... Perfectly situated on the banks of the river in amongst the hustle of the Southbank. It's a brilliant location for anyone wanting to get out and explore Central London on foot as everything is within easy distance. | The rooms were amazing, we were on floor 14 and had fabulous views of the River Thames, St Pauls Cathedral and a host of other instantly recognisable sites. The rooms have everything you need, beds that were the most comfortable I had ever slept in, ample power points and tea / coffee facilities. The staff were very helpful and friendly, it was just a shame that we had such a jam packed weekend and weren't able to make more of my time at the hotel. | I will be back to visit again.",Worcestershire,7/5/2015
The Savoy,5,A hotel that holds special memories....,"I met a a friend for lunch at The Savoy's Kaspar's Seafood Bar and Grill at the weekend (this was my third visit to this restaurant) and I can honestly say that it hasn't declined in any standards, food, service or ambience. | The Savoy is my favourite hotel I have ever been (and been lucky enough to stay over for my 40th too). I am extensively travelled and still go back to this magical hotel, its atmosphere is just beautiful... its warm and friendly, but with very high standards in service that you would expect of a hotel of this type and reputation. It doesn't fail. Before the meal we had a glass of champagne in the American Bar - be sure to check out the pictures of the famous people that have stayed at the hotel in the past just before you enter). The staff in this bar were as attentive as the ones in the restaurant and the nibbles they serve with the drinks are very moreish! | The meal in itself was simply wonderful, a little disappointed that snails were now missing from the menu (they were the best snails outside of France), but we selected the oysters (delicious), I opted for their fish and chips.. (divine) and then the Key Lime Pie. VERY GOOD. | For anyone celebrating a special occasion please go! | The Savoys holds many special memories for me and another thank you again for a wonderful experience, I'm very much looking forward to returning for the roof top bar and restaurant when that is completed.","Cirencester, United Kingdom",7/4/2016
The Dorchester,3,Incorrect billing left a bitter aftertaste,"Lovely surroundings, with good sandwiches, but the afternoon was spoilt by being overcharged by £37 each! No acknowledgement or apology, which left a surprisingly poor aftertaste. This is the first time this has happened to us. Therefore, by all means go, but do state clearly how you would like your card to be charged prior to handing it over.","London, United Kingdom",3/8/2013
The Savoy,5,The Savoy is still fabulous,"This was our first visit to the Savoy since the major refurbishment, and was a special birthday celebration. They have done a fantastic job -- everything looks wonderful, the hotel has lost none of its character whatsoever, and still exudes understated elegance and charm. | The service was impeccable, and as in all good hotels the staff unfailingly get the balance right between friendliness and respect. Nothing is too much trouble, and they are alert at all times to ensure guests' enjoyment, comfort, and convenience. Checking in and out formalities are kept to an absolute minimum, and doormen and baggage staff are helpful, efficient, and cheerful. | The room was lovely, exceptionally comfortable and well-applied, with masses of storage space and the best TV we've ever had in a hotel. It was extremely well serviced twice a day. | Afternoon tea in the Thames Foyer lounge was an absolute joy -- flawless in every respect, providing a memorable birthday occasion and a highlight of our trip. | Fully served breakfast (no buffets here) in the delightful new art deco River Restaurant or the lounge was also impeccable in terms of choice, food quality, and service. | Dinner in the famous Savoy Grill was most enjoyable and good fun. The food and service were again excellent, even though they were very busy. But the atmosphere is lively and vibrant, in contrast to the relative tranquility of most parts of the hotel. | The American Bar has changed little, apart from being smartened up, which is exactly what one would have hoped for because it retains it's super atmosphere. The daily performing American jazz pianist/singer is very good, and the cocktails are still top notch. We did not get a chance to try the new Beaufort Bar, but enjoyed listening to the entertainer (a lady singer) over supper from a nearby table in the lounge. | Don't know whether the Savoy is definitely the best hotel in London, but it's difficult to imagine a better one if one wants a traditional, elegant, British experience. In the past we have found that another iconic traditional hotel on Park Lane could give the Savoy a run for its money, so will have to try that one again also in order to compare them now that the Savoy has been so beautifully refurbished. | We had a great and memorable couple of days, and we look forward to the next special occasion providing an excuse for us to treat ourselves to another stay at the fabulous Savoy.",Essex,2/19/2012
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,A Most Excellent Stay,"I think I have found my new home away from home in London. This is a fabulous hotel in one of the best locations in London.Check-in was exceptional, a very personal and warm welcome from all hotel staff. Hotel facilities and rooms are modern and impeccably clean, with nice aromas around hotel and fresh smelling rooms. Room was small as per usual for London, but had just enough of the right amenities, comforts and little touches to make it special despite its small size. Highly recommend making this hotel your first choice when staying in West London.","Vancouver, Canada",5/20/2017
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,A lovely time at Mondrian,"We had a lovely Easter weekend at the Mondrian, the staff were exceptional and looked after us extremely well. it has a lovely relaxed feel that works really well.

The Rembrandt,5,The Rembrandt Hotel,"I stayed at the Rembrandt with my girlfriend in December 2011. | Some good things about this hotel: | Service - everybody was ready to help and would go the extra mile to make sure your problems were dealt with and wouldn't come up again. | Food - Brekfast, dinner and late night meals are lovely! Full English before heading out to the attractions of London - great stuff. | Rooms - Comfy bed, king size. Mini bar. Television. Bath with air blowing holes. Everything you could want. | I can't give any negatives about this hotel. It's close to the attractions and the Underground, and it helped to make the stay in London all the more better for me and my girlfriend.","Wales, United Kingdom",10/15/2014
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",4,Mandarin Again and happy,"This is our second stay with the MO Hyde Park and this time we had a better stay. Apart from the obvious that it is very central (close to shopping, Hyde Park, transportation, great breakfast, Bar Boulud), I would like to focus on the following: | Room: | Hyde Park view. | the best thing was that it was not only overlooking the park but also that it had a balcony. That was a nice escape for us with the kids. The weather permitting we enjoyed it reading and playing. | The Concierge and front desk: | This time the concierge beat my expectations. all recommendations were perfect. I got a follow up of my experience and sincere insights for places we wanted to go. communication between concierge and front desk works seamlessly. | Staff (Child-friendly, friendly, helpful): | The staff is very comfortable and patient with children. The staff (Sigfried, whom I want to thank again) at the Roseberry handled an incident very patiently and professionally. The following morning the F&amp;D Manager apologized again which shows me that the reporting mechanism works efficiently. The room service is also very efficient and helpful. | Some room amenities need updating which is normal for a hotel as busy and preferred as the MO Hyde Park. But all in all the hotel is a good place to enjoy London and its environs. | I hope that the MO Hyde Park keeps up the performance.",istanbul,7/20/2015
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",4,Exceptional Service,"Stayed for 2 nights and found the room, location and staff very good. | The concierge was fantastic and provided some great recommendations for dinner and drinks. The butler service and Rolls Royce added a special touch that made our short stay enjoyable. | Only negative element was the cigar lounge. Unfortunately the smell of the cigars being enjoyed on the terrace permeates the entire hotel with it evident all the way to the hallway outside our room on the 5th floor.",NA,6/23/2014
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Amazing hotel great staff,I stayed at MOndrian and everything was perfect since the moment i Walked in aries the concierge was terrific.

Corinthia Hotel London,1,Beautiful hotel but not helpful for business travelers,"It's unfortunate to be writing a negative review for the Corinthia. After all, the property was beautiful, the furnishings were comfortable and the staff was exceedingly polite. But the hotel tragically falls short in meeting the needs of a business traveler to London. | Wi-fi coverage was spotty, which staff members were unapologetic about since the service is free. But I would have gladly paid for reliable coverage ... just imagine being a business traveler without access to email. It was also impossible to reach the reception desk by phone, which became an issue because the room was unbearably hot. It was surreal returning to a flawlessly-designed hotel room in which I could not relax or work after a full day of meetings. What's the point of staying in a luxury hotel that can't get the basics right? Does it really matter that they have a spa when I'm struggling to meet a client deadline? Next time I'm in London, I'll stay at a lesser chain like the Westin or Hyatt that actually understands what I need when I'm on the road for business.","New York City, New York",9/2/2012
The Savoy,2,Paying for Savoy's mistake ??!!,"Yes, we were requested to pay when the Savoy could not fulfil our booking. We had requested 2 double rooms, as near to each other as possible. When arriving at the hotel these rooms were unavailable and we were told that we could then have a Junior suite with adjoining room. Great, we thought. It was to celebrate my 50th and that would be lovely. However, there would be a charge of £150 + Vat, £180 in total. Oh dear, we have to pay more even though it's not our fault. So we declined and said will have the original rooms please. With that the receptionist asked her superior who then said it would be complimentary. This should have been so from the beginning. I don't think the Savoy have mastered the art of Customer Relations/Services and they don't want to go the extra inch, let alone mile !! They tried it on and unfortunately first impressions count so I cannot recommend the hotel, in case this happens to anyone else. | I will also add that the breakfast leaves a lot to be desired. A full English is what this country is noted for and the Savoy's efforts leave much to be desired. It should be a hearty, good quality meal that sets you up for the day. We had a sparse little effort, which looked very lost on the plate. There were lots of muffins, dry Danish pastries and toast, but more attention should be given to the cooked breakfast.","London, United Kingdom",10/19/2015
The Savoy,5,Truly Luxurious ... A Perfect 10,"The accommodations are luxurious and the staff are wonderfully gracious and well trained. | From check-in to check-out, the Savoy's staff went the extra mile, and then some, to make us feel special and welcome. | Our room was spotless, warm and inviting.We were lucky enough to have a panoramic view of the Thames and other London landmarks. The marble bathroom had an old-fashion soaker tub, lovely toiletries, a walk-in shower, separate toilet and double-sink counter. An enormous bathroom one can dance in ... and beautiful enough you actually might want to do so. | The hotel is located right in the middle of the Theatre District, so if you want a luxurious stay and be spoiled for choice of shows and restaurants within walking distance -- this is the place to be. | It has been a few months since we stayed here, but our stay was unforgettable.","Vancouver, Canada",4/7/2016
The Lanesborough,5,home away from home....,This is one of the few hotels were you immediately feel at home. The staff is very friendly and helpful. the location is great. the library bar is charming and the 'outdoor' cigar lounge is fantastic.,"Bologna, Italy",9/25/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Great place to stay in the City,"Modern, comfortable hotel in a great location on the South Bank. Stayed here for one night off the back of a friends recommendation. Went out for a birthday dinner so didn't get a chance to try the restaurant or bar but they were pretty busy which is a good sign.","Brighton and Hove, United Kingdom",11/27/2016
The Lanesborough,5,Sheer Class,"Called in last September, actually on the way to another fine hotel for lunch but I was not well. The waiters made me a hot ginger concoction and after a while we left feeling better. We did not make the lunch appointment! | Went back on Friday for Coffee, cake, champagne and malt whiskey (i was 60!) absolutely magnificent. Peerless example of understated class","Marple, United Kingdom",4/2/2018
The Rembrandt,4,Pleasant stay,Stayed here recently on business. Food of a good standard especially lunch. Room well appointed although a little dark. One negative - the bathroom floor is lethal when wet! | Would stay again if visiting London,"Four Marks, United Kingdom",3/5/2018
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Very well thought out rooms,"I stayed at the deluxe king room with a very high ceiling and it was beyond my expectation, every detail has been carefully thought out. The wood panel foyer gives the room a sense of scale and occasion, bathroom is spacious and luxurious. The round table next to the window is perfect both as a desk as well as a dining table. There is a sliding door which transform the bookshelf into a working storage with all the Internet and electrical outlets. Food quality from room service is exceptionally good as well. | The spa 'complex' at the basement is huge and stunning. However, the pool is just too small for any adult to do laps. It looks spectacular with the dim ambience lighting, but what a pity to have all the space and not a pool you can actually use. | Overall, the hotel is outstanding in almost every aspect, service is exceptional during the entire week of my stay.",hong kong,9/19/2013
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Excellent hotel,"Un magnifique hôtel sur les quais : chambres ultra confortables, salles de bains spacieuse... On est proche des standards du palace. La prestation de restauration est aussi de très bonne qualité (de quoi vous réconcilier avec la cuisine britannique !). A noter un très joli rooftop. Of course, les prix sont à la hauteur de la prestation... Mais on est à Londres donc rien de choquant !",NA,1/11/2016
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Over 15 times and always excellent,"It's fair to say I stay at this hotel allot. This week I held a corporate meeting at our offices nearby finished off with some cocktails in The Rumpus Rooms then dinner in the main Resturant. As always, staff are on point, always smart, attentive, quick to remedy any situation, rooms always spotless, beds to die for, gym has very good equipment, food excellent, breakfast great selection (you need to swap the streaky bacon for back this is not the US) and as for Ed the Resturant manger (there are a few) is a true professional, outstanding service. I've stayed in most hotels in London and this is better than many of the 5* I've stayed in. | Come on Mondrian get with the rest and issue a loyalty card! | Simon - IBM.","Warwickshire, United Kingdom",1/20/2017
The Lanesborough,5,A luxurious day,"Attended a wedding reception at the hotel this Christmas. Lovely Christmas tree and beautiful decorations that suits the luxurious vibe of the hotel. | Service was great, food was good, atmosphere was even better. | Was most impressed by the library bar - just beautiful.",NA,12/22/2017
Rhodes Hotel,5,Good value for money!,"The location is very good, with Lancaster Gate tube station and Paddington Train Station just a short walk away. The room (in the annex building) was very new and quiet. The bathroom was big enough, very modern and clean. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend the place!",London,10/31/2012
The Rembrandt,4,Tres bien situé,"Situé en face du Victoria and Albert museum, cet hotel est idéalement situé pour visiter et faire du shopping chez Harrods ! Non loin de Hyde park, bref super ! | Accueil et personnel parfait, bar/restaurant trés sympa et bon, petit dej trés diversifié. | Les chambres sont de taille correcte sans etre tres grandes, la mienne n'avait vue sur rien que le batiment d'en face, pas terrible mais bon, bonne litterie et bonnes préstations !",paris,9/11/2015
The Dorchester,5,Exceptional - as always!,"As always, we had a great time at The Dorchester! This hotel has got it SO right! From the moment you arrive you are treated like you are the most important person in the building, nothing is too much trouble. We stayed for just one night as we were attending a luncheon event the next day, tried to stay for two nights but unfortunately the hotel was full. On arrival, we were greated by Gloria at reception, a more helpful, pleasant and accommodating young lady would be hard to find. We were offered an upgrade from a Deluxe room which we had booked, to a newly refurbished Junior suite which we were delighted to accept, meant waiting about 30 minutes but a glass of bubbly in the bar whilst waiting soon made the time pass swiftly. I asked also for a late checkout on the Monday which Gloria readily agreed for us. On entering 'The Promenade' we were faced with a huge 'Gingerbread house' made as a replica of the Hotel itself, it was magnificent! Also, the sounds of carol singers serenading the afternoon tea customers was heard in the distance which really set the scene for Christmas. When we arrived in our room, our luggage was alread in situ, the room was lovely with an enormous bathroom, only negative was that it was at the back of the hotel overlooking some appartments and not with a 'park' view that I always ask for, had we been staying for more than one night I would have asked to have been moved. We had cockatails and dinner in the Hotel that evening, dinner being in the Grill Room which was excellent and better than I can remember. All in all a wonderful stay in this beautiful hotel, thank you to all the staff which make The Dorchester such a VERY special place to stay in London.","Copthorne, United Kingdom",12/3/2013
Apex London Wall Hotel,4,Eine echte Empfehlung in der Londoner City,"Hotel liegt etwas versteckt und daher auch für London-City eher ruhig. Zimmer sind gut eingerichtet, modern und großzügig. Alles sauber, alle Technik funktioniert, einfacher Zugang zu schnellem Internet. Einziger Kritikpunkt: Am Waschbecken gibt es keinen Handtuchhalter. Personal war sehr freundlich. Der Preis war London-typisch hoch, aber das ist in dieser Stadt halt überall so. Für mich eine klare Empfehlung wenn man Termine in der City hat.",Köln,4/10/2017
The Rembrandt,3,Très bien situé mais ...,"Hôtel idéalement situé pour bien visiter pas mal de sites intéressants, mais les chambres ne sont pas vraiment top, assez vétustes je dirai, pas très spécieuses, petite salle de bain mais assez correcte, literie correcte, chambres mal insonorisées, jai du changer de chambre deux fois, petit déjeuner moyen plus . Tout dépend de la période mais ça reste un rapport qualité/prix assez correcte .","Casablanca, Morocco",8/14/2018
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",4,Pleasant Enough,"I requested a terrace room, it wasn't really a terrace, too small. Also, considering the fact that the doors could not be opened, no one could sit on the terrace. Also, the carpets in the rooms could use a change. They are old and worn. Something in the room, I'm guessing the carpeting, affected my breathing in a negative way.","Framingham, Massachusetts",4/30/2017
Corinthia Hotel London,5,ideal for London,"Great for the clever traveller. We booked three nights at the Corinthia Hotel. It suited our needs perfectly. This is a charming sofisticated hotel in the heart of a teeming London. The hotel itself is beautiful, and the staff are all so friendly. There are a few different restaurants to eat in, to which you should reserve. I would highly recommend..","Cambridge, United Kingdom",12/27/2014
The Lanesborough,5,Refurbished but thankfully hasn't changed,"I love The Lanesborough and have been fortunate to visit for dinner or lunch a few times. | Retiring in December 2015 after it had been refurbished I was a little worried about how things would turn out. Many a good hotel and restaurant have been ruined in such a way, but thankfully this wasn't the case. | The restaurant may look different but it's still a delightful place to be. | Staff are still providing high quality service but more important the food has improved. | The standout for me was the squid ink risotto and millefeuille which although deconstructed was still amazing. | The atmosphere is still very much uptight but that's not a bad thing. I can't wait to return, it's really a delight and an oasis of calm in the centre of London","London, United Kingdom",5/21/2016
The Rembrandt,5,Perfect for London tourism,"We go to London every year just before Christmas and always stay at the Rembrandt. The hotel was built in the Victorian era as a base for upper-middle class shoppers to visit Harrod's Department store, and of course the store is still a great place to visit just 200 yards way. We have found the location to be perfect for all tourism. The tube station (South Kensington) is on the Piccadilly Line direct from Heathrow airport, and in the other direction whisks you into central London. The District and Circle lines also go through S. Kensington station, and these two can get you just about anywhere. The hotel itself is across the road from the main museums, the Victorian and Albert Museum (some say the greatest museum in the world), the Natural History Museum with its fantastic animal sculptures adorning the facade, the Science Museum, and just around the corner is the Albert Hall (a famous concert venue). One can walk to Chelsea (15 minutes), Sloane square (10 minutes), Oxford Street shops (30 minutes) and even the Abbey and the Houses of Parliament (40 minutes). Portobello Road antique market is just 2 tube stops away. There are many good restaurants of all levels and cuisines within walking distance. | This Vistorian hotel has been extensively modernized to accomodate today's tastes, but caters very efficiently to the many tourists that stay there. The Rembrandt is not one of the cheap package tour hotels, and still has an old-style gracious air to it .The large breakfast buffet offers all types of options with full English breakfast at the calorific high end. We like to end the day with a trip to the bar for a pint after the hard work of being a tourist and culture vulture.","Vancouver, Canada",8/4/2011
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Night with my lovely daughter,"Stayed here before and it doesnt disappoint, outstanding staff. Very comfortable room and spa is to die for, early morning swim was divine. Very attentive staff ready at every point to help and advise, truly wonderful xx",essex,5/1/2018
The Savoy,5,Sensacional,"O hotel é sensacional em tudo! Acomodações, restaurantes, funcionários, etc. Ótima localização, próximo aos teatros, restaurantes e várias atrações turísticas de Londres. O tradicional chá das cinco inglês é inesquecível.",NA,2/5/2017
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Lovely weekend,"We stayed only the one night, but were made to feel very at home from the moment we walked in. Greeted with refreshments whilst checking in, the staff were efficient and friendly, a credit to the hotel. Yes rooms are on the the small side -410 and 418 but spotlessly clean and the beds very comfortable. Perfect spot for our girls weekend. Would love to stay again. Thank you","Winchester, United Kingdom",3/13/2018
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Top shelf 5 star,The Corinthian hotel is in a league of its own. | 4 years old with the feeling of yesterday year with a modern twist . | Daily high teas for those who wish run by in house harrods. | Sit in front of the fire inside if you wish . | Step into the court yard of which enjoys a fire place both ends lounges and snugly rugs. | Full service for afternoon teas or a beverage . | We were upgraded to a large suite with a walk in robe . | There are so many pluses for staying from in house florist to restaurants . | Ps you never know who you might see the cast for the new avengers stayed during our week and of course the papparatzi . | Terrific location near Trafalgar Square .,"Mackay, Australia",4/28/2015
Corinthia Hotel London,5,Simply lovely,"This hotel is perfect in every way. The staff are attentive, polite and helpful. The word that comes to mind when in you're in your room is yummy. The smell is welcoming, heated floors in the bathroom and mood lighting. Loved it here and will definitely return.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",11/10/2016
Ridgemount Hotel,5,Really nice hotel in a good location,"We stayed there for a week in June. It felt more like visiting friends than being in a Hotel :-) Very friendly staff and and helpful staff in a very cozy place :-) Good breakfast coffee, toast, eggs, bacon and more served to your table. Room was nice with a good shower. No A/C but a fan was in the room. Free coffee in the lounge with a soda vending machine. | Good location close to the British Museum and Oxford Street.","Reykjavik, Iceland",6/25/2017
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",5,Superstar of a resturant manager,"Day two of our three day trip to Xenia. Hotel is hip, well designed and killer location...room size is meh but you can forgive given location. Have to say our trip has been made so far by our super friendly French friend who runs the resturant. | Always smiling, always curious...attentive genuine service. A credit to autograph collection and the marriot group. Bravo!","Dublin, Ireland",3/25/2017
The Lanesborough,5,The best hotel around Hyde Park,"I live in London and often put up friends or family at hotels in town. I also go to conferences at hotels every month. This time, I put myself up at a hotel while my friends who have small children stayed at my place. I chose the Lanesborough as I always thought it was a lovely dinner or conference venue. The hotel did not disappoint. | Firstly, the appointings are luxurious without being ostentatious. | Secondly, service, from the bell hops to the Concierge, is excellent. While I did not need advice for myself, I asked about events for visiting kids and they arranged an itinerary for my friends. Above and beyond as they say. | Food is as you would expect. Excellent. I will review that separately but lets just say they know they are in competition with the best venues in Mayfair and Belgravia. | There is a cigar bar which is a nice option if you are into that kind of thing. | And the bars are blocked off from the road, which provides a bit more privacy and sound protection than some of the other park lane hotels. | Cleanliness, noise, and general hassle are just not concerns once one enters the marbled foyer.","London, United Kingdom",1/11/2018
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",4,Interessante..,"Posizione interessante, pur se non centrale. Struttura nuova, molto curata. Personale gentile ed efficiente. Colazione buona ed abbondante. Camera pulita ma piccola e senza frigobar. Molto silenziosa e con letto piccolo ma molto comodo.",Lugano,9/5/2015
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,New hotel on the Southbank,"Loved the location! Right on the southwalk with access to a ton of places to eat and shop (small boutique shops in the OXO building and at Gabriel's wharf) steps from Blackfriar's or Southwark tube stations, around the corner from Tate Modern. | Hotel is new and shiny, the staff are helpful hipsters. Decor and the perfume they pump into the lobby reminded me a bit of a Vegas hotel or Palm Springs (a la Riviera hotel). The copper ""hull"" at reception is beautiful. | We had a south facing room (we Pricelined it) so no river view, but we did have a view of the London eye which is 5 mins down the walk. The room was comfortable (north american size), clean and had all the amenities (slippers, house coat, kettle, hair drier, connectivity technology, etc.). | I would definitely stay there again.",Ontario,2/21/2015
The Dorchester,3,Afraid Claridges is far superior,"Taking a slightly different approach to this review - making comparisons with Claridges hotel which is my usual go-to hotel in London. | I stayed here after several amazing stays at Hotel Bel Air and Beverly Hills Hotel in LA - also part of the Dorchester Collection. I had assumed this hotel would be the jewel in their crown but sadly not. | On arrival the lobby of the Dorchester was a real let down. Claridges is gorgeous and really lets you know youre somewhere special. The Dorchester was small, dark and the decor was much less impressive that the Art Deco I had expected. Dont get me started on the tacky cars outside of the hotel and the gangs and mobs that hang around - I am so surprised Dorchester thinks this appeals to guests. | Check in was fabulous, we had a lovely Italian girl that made an effort to welcome | us and escorted us to our room. Great job! The room was recently renovated and looked lovely. It was spacious and bright with a beautiful marble bathroom. However one towel and the bed spread were stained and I had to ask to have them replaced. The slippers were way too small and they didnt have any larger sizes. We watched a movie on the gorgeous B&amp;O but was so dark we couldnt see it - and you cannot adjust the brightness (nor could the technician they sent). They did however comp the cost of the movie. | I found the restaurant situation at the hotel bizarre. Their main space - The Promenade - is like a corridor and the decor feels dated. Breakfast and Afternoon tea were both fine but far from exceptional and I constantly wished I was having a magical experience at Claridges. | Service was overall pretty good. Check in was flawless, the concierge was great and service at The Promenade was attentive. My sister did call for some toothpaste which took 25 mins to arrive and shed already left. | Let me start by saying this is a good hotel. Its not bad. However when I compare this experience to Claridges it pales in comparison so I could not understand why anyone would choose this hotel over Claridges.","Brussels, Belgium",6/15/2018
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,Dandelyon cocktail bar,"Layout, service and cocktails were all fabulous. Try the Dandelyon Sour - it's to die for...yum! | Only criticism was the music - it was quite cheesy and didn't match the vibe or styling. We will definitely be returning though - and soon!","Hampshire, United Kingdom",4/23/2015
Rhodes Hotel,4,Nice hotel in a nice area!,"I spent three days in the hotel with my friends. The room was clean, but there was not enough space between the beds. The owner was helpful and the breakfast was included in the price (eggs, toast bread, fruits, cheese and so on). It was also quite and nearby there were two lovely pubs. The metro station was only 5 minutes away from the hotel! The price was also good, the stuff friendly and it was central (2 minutes from Hyde Park).","Thessaloniki, Greece",1/30/2012
The Dorchester,1,Food poisoning ruined stay!,"Was very much looking forward to staying at the iconic Dorchester Hotel. This was definitely on my list of hotels to stay in worldwide and I had been extremely excited about my visit. | First impressions were ok but not great. Check-in was smooth but on arrival in the room we found a letter addressed to another guest (Mr Long) and also one of our key cards didn't work. These were minor issues, but something which shouldn't really happen at the Dorchester. | During our stay we had afternoon tea, evening meal and an attempt at breakfast (more of that later). Afternoon tea was delightful with an amazing abundance of sandwiches and cakes. Service was a little patchy with waiters bordering on the arrogant but this was the only time I experienced arrogance in the hotel. Food in the evening appeared to be of a very high standard with superb service. Breakfast again was amazing in terms of service but I only managed a small piece of toast as by this time I had succumbed to food poisoning which started in the early hours of the morning. My poor wife then had to put up with me being terribly ill and ruining our stay. | My bout of food poisoning lasted the best part of a week and resulted in me losing 7kg of weight and being terribly ill. Having had to fill in various food questionnaires linked to my illness I can only surmise that the relevant foods were eaten earlier in the day at the Dorchester (I hadn't eaten chicken previously for more than a week and chicken was deemed to be the source of the poisoning). | Samantha (PA to the Director of Food at the Dorchester) has been very thorough in managing my complaint and dealing with me, but more than three weeks have passed since I initially notified the hotel of my food poisoning and so far they have provided me with no results (tests are still being carried out). This is somewhat strange as my test results were back within 48 hours! I can't help but think that I am being strung along until I lose interest. | What this event has taught me is that no matter how amazing the service or how good the setting, food poisoning is terrible and something that no guest should get. In my opinion the Dorchester was responsible for my food poisoning and absolutely ruined what should have been an amazing experience for both my wife and myself. The only positive is that I managed to keep the weight off for Christmas!","West Malling, United Kingdom",12/27/2014
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",4,Great location,"Great service as per previous review the hotel needs a refurb which is actually going to get carried out. | The management were very helpful during our stay , the mandarin bar is one of the best bars in London the service is totally outstanding they are all switched on to make your stay special to be honest they deserve a big compliment as they were exceptional.","Chelmsford, United Kingdom",3/30/2015
Rhodes Hotel,5,Fantástico,"Llegamos en plena crisis del volcán de Islandia, y el hotel fue fantástico. La habitación limpia, el baño perfecto, ni un ruido, tranquilidad total. | Además, reservamos para 3 noches, pero luego solo estuvimos 1 y se portaron muy bien y agradables con nosotros. | Fue una suerte haberlo encontrado. | Este será el hotel cuando volvamos a Londres.",Madrid,5/2/2010
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,5,The first wedding to be held at the Mondrian in the Rumpus room.,"Last night we held the most unbelievable event at the Mondrian Hotel, The Old Sea Containers Building. I cannot rate them high enough, the service, was friendly and charming they could not do enough for us, Kate and Rachel were helpful and supportive throughout. The food was fabulous, unique, tasty and beautifully presented, the chef took every request on board and provided food to die for!!! The layout of each room was perfect nothing was too much trouble and the final result was stunning. The Rumpus room was charming, sophisticated and elegant. Walking on the terrace, which surrounds the room, brought the Thames and the skyline along it, well into view. The final touch were our rooms which were comfortable and stylish, the modern art work and contemporary style, just made the the whole experience pure magic.","London, United Kingdom",3/28/2016
"Bulgari Hotel, London",5,Unbelievably stylish - simply perfect,"This is clearly a hotel built by jewellery makers (Bulgari of course) - it is a GEM, there is no other word for it. Everything is flawless, like a red diamond... The bedroom, the service, the lounge area, the restaurant - nothing is too much trouble either (welcome cake for birthday occasion)... | Our very romantic stay and our new pied a terre in London! we shall be returning quickly!",Exeter,8/3/2013
The Dorchester,5,Afternoon Tea,This place is such a delight! I booked afternoon tea for my partners birthday and i have 0 regrets. Everything right from beginning to end was amazing. The service the staff the hotel the atmosphere. I just couldn't say a bad word even if i tried. We were served my a lovely man called franceso he was extremely chatty and well mannered. I guess that is part of his job working in such a fine hotel. But this is definitely a must for anyone planning on a special afternoon tea treat.,"St Albans, United Kingdom",5/27/2017
Hartley Hotel,4,Wonderful Budget Hotel,"I went to London for a Short break with my family. I was looking for a budget hotel. I found a very convenient price hotel, Hartley hotel B&amp;B Hotel. Recently, I came to know that ownership has been changed and hotel also refurbished and decorated. I stayed four nights everything was excellent. e.g.Breakfast, customer service, rooms, central heating and free parking facility. found nearby grocery shop and restaurant. Even i used kitchen for my little baby. | I spoke to new owner Name Mr Piratheepan, he said he is ambitious to turn a reputed hotel. I wish him good luck for his new business. | Thank all members of staff who look after us very well. | I would definitely go back to this hotel",North berwick,12/22/2012

Can't think of a better location, especially since it's away from the teaming crowds but so amazingly convenient nonetheless.

Dare you to find a better deal in town!!","Toronto, Canada",9/6/2016
The Savoy,5,Popped for a £220m look,Yes we popped in to have a look around and it was lovely - we were a little disappointed with the Beaufort Bar not the real wow I had expected! We re-mortgaged our houses and had a few drinks and nibbles. Looked great but it really it should having spent £220m. Mmmmm. | Would I go back yes I I was not paying and was invited!,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",7/7/2012
The Savoy,5,"wonderfull,but wait for dinner in the river room","first visit back to the savoy since its refurbishment,very impressed!staff were excellent,could not have been better.the hotel and the staff are exactly what you expect of this iconic hotel. the only dissapointment was that the river room restaurant is closed at the moment,we had dinner in simpsons restaurant instead,the food was resonably good the staff excellent,but the evening was dominated by a very loud pianist,playing anything but background music very aggressivly,even the staff were unhappy with it .will wait for the river room restaurant to reopen before returning",wigan,4/16/2013
A To Z Hotel,4,"Seriously, it was £49.99 for a twin room - what do you expect?","If you want to impress the wife or stay somewhere really nice, this place isn't for you. If you want cheap and basic, it's ideal. A twin room in London on cup final/royal wedding day for under £50 including breakfast will do for me. It's clean, the beds are alright, the shower is ok and the staff are friendly. After a day out if all you want is a bed, it does the job. | If you want 5*, pay 5* prices.","Stafford, United Kingdom",5/26/2018
The Rembrandt,4,Overnight stay!,"We booked this as it was a deal on Secret Escapes and half price. The one thing we didn't check was parking which there isn't any! The closest place is a 10min walk away and is an extra £35 so keep that in mind. The hotel itself is excellent as are the staff. The food and drinks are reasonably priced considering where the Hotel is placed so don't expect a cocktail for less then around £9 or a beer for less than £4! The staff are very friendly and make you feel welcome as soon as you walk in. The room was superb, a huge bed and a jacuzzi bath which was unexpected. Overall a great hotel but parking can be an issue but to add the hotel will valet park your car for you.","Exeter, United Kingdom",4/3/2016
