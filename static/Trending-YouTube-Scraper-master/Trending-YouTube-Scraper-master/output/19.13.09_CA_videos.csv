M&M's are available in just about every color known to man, but there is one color that is objectively the best: green. Scientists have puzzled over this curiosity since the inception of M&M's in 1941. MIT Professor of Cognitive Sciences Dr. Bertrand Mathers has dedicated the entirety of his postdoctoral studies to this conundrum, labeling it the Green M&M Dilemma. With the dedicated assistance of researcher Loretta Marshall, Mathers has finally unveiled his ultimate theory on the subject. “After more than fifty years of sleepless nights, proposed and rejected ideas and quite a few cavities,” Dr. Mathers read from a lectern at an August 15, 2019 press conference, “My life’s work has finally reached its culmination. I have found the solution to the Green M&M Dilemma.” Dr. Mathers, never one to skimp on dramatics, spun around to face a chalkboard covered by a red velvet curtain. Pulling it aside, he revealed his grand solution: ‘The color green is the best color, so therefore green M&M’s are the best M&M’s.’ A stunned silence in the crowd was quickly following by a standing ovation lasting over five minutes. Finally, as the applause died down, Dr. Mathers, red-cheeked and clutching a bottle of celebratory champagne, added: “And now we begin our studies into why blue M&M’s are definitely the next best M&M’s!”Check out Claire's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/csaffitz/Want Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promoStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appetit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPnABOUT BON APPÉTITCook with confidence using Bon Appetit’s kitchen tips, recipes, videos, and restaurant guides.

Place in a large container with a mixture of red wine, water, salt, pepper, garlic and sugar and let it marinate for 26 hours. Cut off it’s neck and wings and put aside. Rub and stuff the bird with garlic, herbs, basil, thyme, oregano and a secret Quan Ut Ut ingredient. Put the bird in the BBQ pit and smoke for 2 hours with jackfruit wood. After, pour more wine inside the tray with the ostrich and add onions, carrots, water, BBQ power and thyme. Finally,  put a towel on the ostrich and cover it with foil. Place in the BBQ pit for 16 hours at 105C degrees. Take the cooked bird out and hand shred the meat for serving. Serve 200grams of shredded meat on a platter with house cornbread, pink coleslaw and mashed potatoes with the au jus gravy.🍲AU JUS GRAVY:  Separate the fat from the Ostrich juices by putting the liquid in the fridge to cool and then skimming the fat layer, leaving the collagen and broth.

Put the filling in a plastic bag and squeeze it in the egg white. Top with bacon and jalapeno.🍖GIANT BUFFALO WINGS: Boil wings for 20 min then remove remaining feathers.

Which one of these girls do you relate to the most?? ✅ Don't forget to check out our new Brooklyn & Bailey AirPod Cases here:  https://brooklynandbaileyshop.com/collections/airpods We were obviously just having TOO MUCH fun by creating this sketch for you! No offense to any of these character types, as we sometimes fall into these categories ourselves! I think most girls have a little #VSCO, Soft, or E-Girl in them! Even if you’re not one of these stereotypes entirely, you’ll probably find that you at least take on a few of these quirks, or even fashion statements, and hardly knew it! We played up the “VSCO Girl” who is always wearing an oversized t-shirt, birkenstock sandals, and always has a scrunchie (or 7) on hand! She’s the biggest “savetheturtles” activist, and will not tolerate anyone who uses plastic straws! How many of YOU are VSCO girls??We also focused on the “Soft Girl” personality from TikTok, and this girl is ALL THINGS GIRLY! You’ll catch them wearing lots of pink blush, and hair clips! They love anything and everything that is pastel pink, and they never leave the house without their lip gloss! 💗Lastly, you’ll see the well known “E-Girl” who is the more ~moody~ personality. You’ll generally see them in darker clothing, rocking winged eyeliner, and 9 times out of 10 their tongue will be out of their mouth and use lots of hand signs! 😛Which of these TikTok personalities do you relate to the most??

Watch the final trailer for #DoctorSleepMovie now.“Doctor Sleep” continues the story of Danny Torrance, 40 years after his terrifying stay at the Overlook Hotel in The Shining.  Ewan McGregor, Rebecca Ferguson and newcomer Kyliegh Curran star in the supernatural thriller, directed by Mike Flanagan, from his own screenplay based upon the novel by Stephen King.Still irrevocably scarred by the trauma he endured as a child at the Overlook, Dan Torrance has fought to find some semblance of peace.  But that peace is shattered when he encounters Abra, a courageous teenager with her own powerful extrasensory gift, known as the “shine.”  Instinctively recognizing that Dan shares her power, Abra has sought him out, desperate for his help against the merciless Rose the Hat and her followers, The True Knot, who feed off the shine of innocents in their quest for immortality.Forming an unlikely alliance, Dan and Abra engage in a brutal life-or-death battle with Rose.  Abra’s innocence and fearless embrace of her shine compel Dan to call upon his own powers as never before—at once facing his fears and reawakening the ghosts of the past.“Doctor Sleep” stars Ewan McGregor (“Star Wars: Episodes I, II & III,” “T2 Trainspotting”) as Dan Torrance, Rebecca Ferguson (the “Mission: Impossible” films, “The Greatest Showman”) as Rose the Hat, and Kyliegh Curran, in her major feature film debut, as Abra.  The main ensemble cast also includes Carl Lumbly, Zahn McClarnon, Emily Alyn Lind, Bruce Greenwood, Jocelin Donahue, Alex Essoe and Cliff Curtis.Trevor Macy and Jon Berg produced the film, with Roy Lee, Scott Lumpkin, Akiva Goldsman and Kevin McCormick serving as executive producers.Flanagan’s behind-the-scene creative team was led by director of photography Michael Fimognari (“The Haunting of Hill House”), production designers Maher Ahmad (“Get Hard”) and Elizabeth Boller (“Hush”), and costume designer Terry Anderson (“Den of Thieves”).  The music score is composed by The Newton Brothers (“The Haunting of Hill House”).SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/WarnerBrosUK Warner Bros. UK – The official home of Warner Bros. movie trailers in the UK.

But that peace is shattered when he encounters Abra, a courageous teenager with her own powerful extrasensory gift, known as the “shine.”  Instinctively recognizing that Dan shares her power, Abra has sought him out, desperate for his help against the merciless Rose the Hat and her followers, The True Knot, who feed off the shine of innocents in their quest for immortality.Forming an unlikely alliance, Dan and Abra engage in a brutal life-or-death battle with Rose.  Abra’s innocence and fearless embrace of her shine compel Dan to call upon his own powers as never before—at once facing his fears and reawakening the ghosts of the past.“Doctor Sleep” stars Ewan McGregor (“Star Wars: Episodes I, II & III,” “T2 Trainspotting”) as Dan Torrance, Rebecca Ferguson (the “Mission: Impossible” films, “The Greatest Showman”) as Rose the Hat, and Kyliegh Curran, in her major feature film debut, as Abra.  The main ensemble cast also includes Carl Lumbly, Zahn McClarnon, Emily Alyn Lind, Bruce Greenwood, Jocelin Donahue, Alex Essoe and Cliff Curtis.Trevor Macy and Jon Berg produced the film, with Roy Lee, Scott Lumpkin, Akiva Goldsman and Kevin McCormick serving as executive producers.Flanagan’s behind-the-scene creative team was led by director of photography Michael Fimognari (“The Haunting of Hill House”), production designers Maher Ahmad (“Get Hard”) and Elizabeth Boller (“Hush”), and costume designer Terry Anderson (“Den of Thieves”).  The music score is composed by The Newton Brothers (“The Haunting of Hill House”).SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/WarnerBrosUK Warner Bros. UK – The official home of Warner Bros. movie trailers in the UK.

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReviewAs they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together! If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in-depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously.

It turns out that airplanes have strict rules regarding their pathways in the sky – for safety reasons, and for the sake of staying friendly with continental neighbors. Some of the places they’re not allowed to fly over might surprise you!For example, planes won’t fly directly over the Earth’s poles and over the Pacific Ocean. You can't see planes over Tibet and over the City of Mecca. The airspace over Walt Disney World and Disneyland is also a no-fly zone. The same applies to Area 51 but we don't know why.

This is largely due to the Himalayan Mountains. First of all, if a plane has to land in an emergency situation, mountains aren’t exactly the ideal impromptu runway.- There’s a strong magnetic field in Makkah. As mentioned earlier, a magnetic field can cause navigational problems for pilots.- George Washington’s House is considered a National Historic Landmark, so to prevent further damage to the historic home, even from air vibrations in the sky, the airspace above George and Martha’s house was declared a no-fly zone. - In 2003, the Disney Corporation put “temporary” no-fly zones over both their parks, but somehow, they just stuck.- Due to the many presidents and world-wide VIPs that visit Camp David, the airspace above the whole compound is a no-fly zone for safety reasons. - Kennedy Space Center in Florida is a no-fly zone. There’s a lot of NASA and U.S. Airforce activity that goes on here – pretty important work. So safety for all parties is the top priority. - Buckingham Palace is meant to protect the Queen and the royal family, so of course a no-fly zone was established above it. - The Indian government place a no-fly zone above the area of the Taj Mahal in 2006 to safeguard this important historical building and the many tourists who come to witness its majesty.

Let's roll up our sleeves, wade into the sewers and dig into the details of how the saga ends. This is the ending of It: Chapter Two explained.And before you open the door labeled very scary, be warned: Spoilers await you.Stephen King's novel It isn't just the story of a creepy clown terrorizing some kids and then returning to do it all over again when they're adults. There's a whole cosmology to the saga, which includes a giant, godlike turtle that coughed up the known universe when it had a tummy ache. Aside from a few subtle nods here and there, the movies mostly sidestep the ancient, interdimensional mythology of the book, but one element does show up in It: Chapter Two - the true form of It.When he goes to visit the Shokopiwah tribe and takes one of their vision-granting concoctions, Mike learns that It came to Earth in a meteor strike that left a crater in Derry, and is made up of Deadlights, mostly orange but sometimes-blue spheres of light of immense power. Though the lights can be seen in brief moments in the first film, It appears entirely as deadlights as Chapter Two reaches its climax, and even after taking on other forms, the deadlights are still visibly powering the creature, becoming increasingly weaker as the Losers literally bring It down to size.It's true form is revealed because the Losers perform the Ritual of Chüd, a ceremony that differs pretty wildly in the movie from the way it works in the book. The movie's take on the ritual involves each member of the club burning a token of his or her childhood and reciting a chant to make the Deadlights turn dark, then trapping the Deadlights inside a pyramid-shaped relic Mike stole.The ritual is the key to defeating It in the book, though it takes two tries 27 years apart. But the Losers' attempt essentially fails in the movie, at least at first. That's because it's revealed Mike lied to everyone in an attempt to simply bring them all back together. The ritual wasn't successful before when the Native Americans tried to do it, and it doesn't kill It when the Losers try it this time, either. At least, not until they've gone through the wringer just a little bit more so they can truly overcome the fears that feed It.

Welcome to episode #4 of my thrift store makeover series where I take something I've found out of a thrift store (or actually, in this case i found it at a yard sale, but still) and I strip it down and give it a makeover.

I believe this is a vintage item, but it hasn't aged well at all. It definitely needs a makeover.
