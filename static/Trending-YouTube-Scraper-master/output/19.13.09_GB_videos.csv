Place in a large container with a mixture of red wine, water, salt, pepper, garlic and sugar and let it marinate for 26 hours. Cut off it’s neck and wings and put aside. Rub and stuff the bird with garlic, herbs, basil, thyme, oregano and a secret Quan Ut Ut ingredient. Put the bird in the BBQ pit and smoke for 2 hours with jackfruit wood.

M&M's are available in just about every color known to man, but there is one color that is objectively the best: green. Scientists have puzzled over this curiosity since the inception of M&M's in 1941. MIT Professor of Cognitive Sciences Dr. Bertrand Mathers has dedicated the entirety of his postdoctoral studies to this conundrum, labeling it the Green M&M Dilemma. With the dedicated assistance of researcher Loretta Marshall, Mathers has finally unveiled his ultimate theory on the subject. “After more than fifty years of sleepless nights, proposed and rejected ideas and quite a few cavities,” Dr. Mathers read from a lectern at an August 15, 2019 press conference, “My life’s work has finally reached its culmination. I have found the solution to the Green M&M Dilemma.” Dr. Mathers, never one to skimp on dramatics, spun around to face a chalkboard covered by a red velvet curtain. Pulling it aside, he revealed his grand solution: ‘The color green is the best color, so therefore green M&M’s are the best M&M’s.’ A stunned silence in the crowd was quickly following by a standing ovation lasting over five minutes. Finally, as the applause died down, Dr. Mathers, red-cheeked and clutching a bottle of celebratory champagne, added: “And now we begin our studies into why blue M&M’s are definitely the next best M&M’s!”Check out Claire's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/csaffitz/Want Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promoStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appetit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPnABOUT BON APPÉTITCook with confidence using Bon Appetit’s kitchen tips, recipes, videos, and restaurant guides.

Then things got even better. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle married and took on the role of Duke and Duchess of the world. But in a little over 12 months something has happened to drastically change the public mood. Maybe with the arrival of their son, Archie, the couple just want some more privacy. But there has been an unintended result - the tabloids have turned, and the blame game – much of it directed at Meghan – has been fierce. As Karl Stefanovic reports from London, the controversy is a major headache for the royal family.WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://9now.nine.com.au/60-minutes?linkpos=videodescriptionLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

It turns out that airplanes have strict rules regarding their pathways in the sky – for safety reasons, and for the sake of staying friendly with continental neighbors. Some of the places they’re not allowed to fly over might surprise you!For example, planes won’t fly directly over the Earth’s poles and over the Pacific Ocean. You can't see planes over Tibet and over the City of Mecca. The airspace over Walt Disney World and Disneyland is also a no-fly zone. The same applies to Area 51 but we don't know why.

This is largely due to the Himalayan Mountains. First of all, if a plane has to land in an emergency situation, mountains aren’t exactly the ideal impromptu runway.- There’s a strong magnetic field in Makkah. As mentioned earlier, a magnetic field can cause navigational problems for pilots.- George Washington’s House is considered a National Historic Landmark, so to prevent further damage to the historic home, even from air vibrations in the sky, the airspace above George and Martha’s house was declared a no-fly zone. - In 2003, the Disney Corporation put “temporary” no-fly zones over both their parks, but somehow, they just stuck.- Due to the many presidents and world-wide VIPs that visit Camp David, the airspace above the whole compound is a no-fly zone for safety reasons. - Kennedy Space Center in Florida is a no-fly zone. There’s a lot of NASA and U.S. Airforce activity that goes on here – pretty important work. So safety for all parties is the top priority. - Buckingham Palace is meant to protect the Queen and the royal family, so of course a no-fly zone was established above it. - The Indian government place a no-fly zone above the area of the Taj Mahal in 2006 to safeguard this important historical building and the many tourists who come to witness its majesty.

Let's roll up our sleeves, wade into the sewers and dig into the details of how the saga ends. This is the ending of It: Chapter Two explained.And before you open the door labeled very scary, be warned: Spoilers await you.Stephen King's novel It isn't just the story of a creepy clown terrorizing some kids and then returning to do it all over again when they're adults. There's a whole cosmology to the saga, which includes a giant, godlike turtle that coughed up the known universe when it had a tummy ache. Aside from a few subtle nods here and there, the movies mostly sidestep the ancient, interdimensional mythology of the book, but one element does show up in It: Chapter Two - the true form of It.When he goes to visit the Shokopiwah tribe and takes one of their vision-granting concoctions, Mike learns that It came to Earth in a meteor strike that left a crater in Derry, and is made up of Deadlights, mostly orange but sometimes-blue spheres of light of immense power. Though the lights can be seen in brief moments in the first film, It appears entirely as deadlights as Chapter Two reaches its climax, and even after taking on other forms, the deadlights are still visibly powering the creature, becoming increasingly weaker as the Losers literally bring It down to size.It's true form is revealed because the Losers perform the Ritual of Chüd, a ceremony that differs pretty wildly in the movie from the way it works in the book. The movie's take on the ritual involves each member of the club burning a token of his or her childhood and reciting a chant to make the Deadlights turn dark, then trapping the Deadlights inside a pyramid-shaped relic Mike stole.The ritual is the key to defeating It in the book, though it takes two tries 27 years apart. But the Losers' attempt essentially fails in the movie, at least at first. That's because it's revealed Mike lied to everyone in an attempt to simply bring them all back together. The ritual wasn't successful before when the Native Americans tried to do it, and it doesn't kill It when the Losers try it this time, either. At least, not until they've gone through the wringer just a little bit more so they can truly overcome the fears that feed It.

Welcome to episode #4 of my thrift store makeover series where I take something I've found out of a thrift store (or actually, in this case i found it at a yard sale, but still) and I strip it down and give it a makeover. This always involves a lot of color, sometimes glitter, and a lot of PAINT. Hope you enjoy!This time I'm flipping a wooden carousel wall hanging that I found at a yard sale. I believe this is a vintage item, but it hasn't aged well at all. It definitely needs a makeover. I want to hang this in my art room (ART ROOM TOUR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6xKb3mA8DY) which happens to be full of color and cutesy stuff. I'm going to be doing a lot of decorating to get this looking bright and festive so it fits better with my craft room aesthetic LOL.CHECK OUT THE WHOLE SERIES:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtabhYAHTEc&list=PL807ptvhwHpfMWG3wWPhTTeYRRJtTBqxC___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/GET TO KNOW MEVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

Lucky for us all, she didn't. In the two years since that fateful day, Lizzo has become a bonafide breakout star. Everything she does now earns attention, whether she’s strutting the Met Gala red carpet in head-to-toe pink or posting videos of herself twerking on Instagram. In April, she made her Coachella debut and released her debut album on Atlantic Records, Cuz I Love You. Two months later, at the 2019 BET Awards, she delivered a rollicking, knockout performance of “Truth Hurts,” complete with backup dancers, a wedding cake–themed set, and a flute solo that made Rihanna stand up and cheer. She also landed a major beauty campaign with Urban Decay; filmed a role in Hustlers with Jennifer Lopez and Cardi B; hit the fifth spot on Billboard’s Top 100 chart; and earned two 2019 MTV Video Music Award nominations, including Best New Artist. To say she’s having a moment would be an understatement—she’s having the moment.And, to celebrate her latest win — landing our cover for ELLE's 2019 Women in Music issue — Lizzo took her turn against our #SongAssociation clock. Tune in as she sings Beyoncé, Janelle Monáe, and some of her own tunes, in an effort to top our scoreboard.READ Lizzo's #ELLEWIM cover story: http://elle.com/lizzo-elleSUBSCRIBE to ELLE http://bit.ly/SubscribeToELLE"

Brick making is a time consuming process. To amass enough bricks for a large scale firing will take a long time to do. In the previous hut (that burnt down) bricks were stored inside the hut out of the rain to dry before firing. This took up considerable space within the hut. So with this hut, bricks were stored under the eves of the hut forming a temporary wall around the work space. Clay was taken from a pit and carried to the hut site. The clay was mixed with water in a pit. The ceramic brick mold (made of fired clay in a previous video) was soaked in water and wood ash to make it slippery so that the clay would slide out easily. Bricks were then formed on the floor of half the hut. When the bricks had dried enough they were then stacked under the eaves to form a growing wall. I'll continue making clay bricks and when an opportunity rises, I will take them out and fire them, upgrading them from adobe bricks to fired clay bricks. These will in theory be used in a permanent hut constructed from bricks and mortar. About Primitive Technology:Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

If you're dealing with copyright issues yourself IRL, check out my very own https://copyrightcourse.com Learn all of my tips and tricks to fight demonetization and bogus copyright claims. Here's my review of the Seinfeld finale that also features a Johnny Cochran parody: https://youtu.be/lhg3hW3K_KACheck out Adam Neely's video on Dark Horse: https://youtu.be/0ytoUuO-qvgWikipedia sums it up perfectly: “In a jury trial, a Chewbacca defense is a legal strategy in which a criminal defense lawyer tries to confuse the jury rather than refute the case of the prosecutor. It is an intentional distraction or obfuscation.Because a Chewbacca defense distracts and misleads, it is an example of a red herring. It is also an example of an irrelevant conclusion, a type of informal fallacy in which one making an argument fails to address the issue in question.The name Chewbacca defense comes from Chef Aid, an episode of the American animated series South Park. The episode, which premiered on October 7, 1998, satirizes the O. J. Simpson murder trial—particularly attorney Johnnie Cochran's closing argument for the defense. In the episode, Cochran (voiced by Trey Parker) bases his argument on a false premise about the 1983 film Return of the Jedi. He asks the jury why a Wookiee like Chewbacca would want to live on Endor with the much smaller Ewoks when it does not make sense. He argues that if Chewbacca living on Endor does not make sense—and if even mentioning Chewbacca in the case does not make sense—then the jury must acquit.In the Simpson murder trial, the real Johnnie Cochran tried to convince jurors that a glove found at the crime scene, alleged to have been left by the killer, could not be Simpson's because it did not fit Simpson's hand. Because the prosecution relied on the glove as evidence of Simpson's presence at the scene, Cochran argued that the lack of fit proved Simpson's innocence: It makes no sense; it doesn't fit; if it doesn't fit, you must acquit. If it doesn't fit, you must acquit was a refrain that Cochran also used in response to other points of the case.”(Thanks to Skillshare for sponsoring this video and helping to make this channel possible)New episodes weekly!

I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  Today I'm taking a break from representing clients and teaching law students how to kick ass in law school to take on lawyers in the movies and on TV.  While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth.
